It seems promising so far.</p>\n<p>The rest of the episode was sparked by a tweak about advice to new software Developers. Stan replied: “Time management. Work when you work, but don’t over work. When I was new I kept absurdly long days, sometimes worked on the weekend and was always connected by email. I’m a better engineer now that I manage time boundaries for myself.”</p>\n<p>This leads into what exactly he means and concrete takeaways from what we’ve learned through our career paths and some mistakes we’ve made along the way.</p>\n<p>This episode feels a little different than some of our other ones. Mostly because Jon was really interested in learning everything he can from Stan.</p>\n<p>Listen in, let us know what you think!</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening,</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 28 - Work When You Work, But Don't Overwork","date":"January 24, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/028-lwatol-20190124.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":["Career Advice","Productivity","Technology"],"tags":["email"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/episode-28-work-when-you-work-but-dont-overwork/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-27-milkshake-flavored-pop-tarts-customer-support-and-solo-a-star-wars-story/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 27 - Milkshake Flavored Pop-Tarts, Customer Support, and Solo: A Star Wars Story"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-29-the-polar-vortex-is-upon-us/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 29 - The Polar Vortex is Upon Us!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
