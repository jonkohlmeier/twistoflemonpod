Why is he at home and not in Studio? The joys of home ownership. Listen in to hear Jon’s first fix as a homeowner.</p>\n<p>Next up, Stan has 2 reviews on milkshakes. First a milkshake from the Atlanta airport based on a recommendation. He doesn’t have a great review of it.</p>\n<p>Next he returned to the scene of the original good Five Guys milkshake. This visit isn’t up to par.</p>\n<p>Milkshake quality depends on craftsmanship and employees taking pride in their work.</p>\n<p>We got a couple more iTunes reviews that we want to shout out to. Thanks for listening and taking time to leave feedback. We really appreciate it!</p>\n<p>After a quick update on the donate to Pastor Fritsche campaign, Stan and Jon talk meatloaf.</p>\n<p>They even decide what they’ll talk about next week while on air.</p>\n<p>Donate to Fritsche, let us know. You’ll want to read the letter that comes with the sticker.</p>\n<p>Talk next week,</p>\n<p>-Jon Kohlmeier &#x26; Stan Lemon\n.mp3/twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/\n[audio mp3=”<a href=\"https://twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/021-lwatol-20181206.mp3%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/audio%5C%5D\">https://twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/021-lwatol-20181206.mp3”\\]\\[/audio\\]</a></p>\n<h3>Show notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.grindhouseburgers.com\">Grindhouse Killer Burgers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9LE0UW2jmno\">Whirlpool Freezer Defrost Fix Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twistoflemonpod.com/fritsche/\">Support Fritsche.
