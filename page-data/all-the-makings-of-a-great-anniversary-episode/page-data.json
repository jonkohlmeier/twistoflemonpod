All the potential of a great anniversary episode but we are still not at one year of Life with a Twist of Lemon.</p>\n<p>To kick off the episode Jon had a couple of milkshakes on his trip. The first from Hubbard Avenue Diner with a strong showing. Their claim to fame is pie though.. so we talk about that a little bit too. Second milkshake was custard based from Oscars’ in West Allis, WI. This was a less great custard milkshake.</p>\n<p>Is this the end of Stan’s Router Woes? He has a new TP-Link router that he’s happy with so far.</p>\n<p>Jon and Mrs. Kohlmeier spent some time this past weekend traveling and taking in the sites of Spring Green, WI. They Toured Frank Lloyd Wright’s estate, Taliesin, and saw a performance of Macbeth at American Players Theatre.</p>\n<p>New Mac news this week. We spend some time talking about 3D Touch and the new changes to the MacBook lines. That leads into a brief discussion on the MacBook Touch Bar.</p>\n<p>Finally we close out the episode with a review of Spider-Man: Far From Home. Stan loved it. Jon went in with higher expectations. We drop spoilers. So if you haven’t seen it, stop listening before we ruin it for you!</p>\n<p>Thanks for Listening!
