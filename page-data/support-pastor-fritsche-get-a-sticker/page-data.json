We’re looking to support Pastor Joel Fritsche and his work in the Dominican Republic. Here’s the deal, you donate - send us proof of donating $50 or more and we’ll send you a limited edition Life with a Twist of Lemon sticker (3” x 3”).</p>\n<p>Even better is Stan will be matching the first $1000 raised.</p>\n<p>Listen in to hear about the work of Pastor Fritsche with the seminary in the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p>From there Stan has *another* beef with CPH study notes. He rants a little bit. I apologize to our non-LCMS listeners for the inside baseball. Jon calls people out by name… overall it’s a bitter segment. You can skip it if you’d like. (Props to CPH for no more red algae).</p>\n<p>Finally we switch gears to Tech. Stan quit Gmail this week. We talk about Google, security and the evolution of correspondence and email.</p>\n<p>Thanks for tuning in and we hope to be sending you a sticker soon!</p>\n<p>- Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<h3>Show notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/twistoflemonpod/fritsche\">Learn more about Supporting Pastor Joel Fritsche.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cph.org\">CPH.org</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Support Pastor Fritsche, get a Sticker.","date":"November 29, 2018","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/020-lwatol-20181129.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":["Technology","Theology"],"tags":["Fritsche","roof","email","baseball"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/support-pastor-fritsche-get-a-sticker/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/jon-moved-in/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jon Moved In!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/homeownership-woes-milkshakes-and-meatloaf-the-food-not-the-hiphop-artist/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Homeownership Woes, Milkshakes and Meatloaf (The food, not the hiphop artist)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
