Turns out Stan doesn’t know how to play.</p>\n<p>Jon’s boss is out of the office this week, so Jon’s in charge! That leads into us talking about opening our own e-commerce store complete with lemonade glasses. Stan doesn’t like the idea of a tornado shaped lemonade glass.</p>\n<p>Jon went to Five Guys and did not have a great experience. The burger cooks didn’t value craftsmanship as much as we do here at Life with a Twist of Lemon.</p>\n<p>Because our dear friend Crysten did not understand any of the Star Trek banter, this week we decide to talk about resumes.</p>\n<p>Stan talks about some to dos and not dos for what to include on a resume. Where his resume has been and what the current format is.</p>\n<p>This turns into one of those practical advice episodes that everyone likes so much. So stick through the early part of the episode to hear the Lemon drop some wisdom.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening,</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p>[audio mp3=”<a href=\"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/057-lwatol-20190808.mp3%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/audio%5C%5D\">https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/057-lwatol-20190808.mp3”\\]\\[/audio\\]</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"You probably shouldn't include Euchre on your resume","date":"August 08, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/057-lwatol-20190808.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":[{"name":"Career Advice","slug":"career-advice"},{"name":"Food","slug":"food"},{"name":"General","slug":"general"},{"name":"Productivity","slug":"productivity"}],"tags":[{"name":"ecommerce","slug":"ecommerce"},{"name":"euchre","slug":"euchre"},{"name":"five guys","slug":"five-guys"},{"name":"hamburgers","slug":"hamburgers"},{"name":"jon kohlmeier","slug":"jon-kohlmeier"},{"name":"life with a twist of lemon","slug":"life-with-a-twist-of-lemon"},{"name":"resume","slug":"resume"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/you-probably-shouldnt-include-euchre-on-your-resume/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/to-boldly-go-to-season-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"To Boldly Go.... to Season 2"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-impossible-episode/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Impossible Episode"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
