Jon spent nearly 2 hours shoveling after the most recent snow storm. Stan asks Jon about snow removal tools and discovers that he finally ordered a snowblower! Somewhere in there we go off on a tangent on Star Trek.</p>\n<p>All weekend Stan was tweeting about the Alliance. Jon learns that this isn’t a World of Warcraft or Firefly reference.. but just more football. Needless to say, Stan is really excited about it.</p>\n<p>We talk about twitter and whether it’s a good platform to have a conversation/interview. #KaraJack.</p>\n<p>Leave a review on iTunes. We’ll read it on air and if you send Stan your address we’ll send a sticker!</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening,</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p>[audio mp3=”<a href=\"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/031-lwatol-20190214.mp3%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/audio%5C%5D\">https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/031-lwatol-20190214.mp3”\\]\\[/audio\\]</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 31 - Snow, Football, Star Trek and Twitter","date":"February 14, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/031-lwatol-20190214.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":[{"name":"General","slug":"general"},{"name":"Home Ownership","slug":"home-ownership"},{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"technology"}],"tags":[{"name":"football","slug":"football"},{"name":"jon kohlmeier","slug":"jon-kohlmeier"},{"name":"life with a twist of lemon","slug":"life-with-a-twist-of-lemon"},{"name":"snowblower","slug":"snowblower"},{"name":"stan lemon","slug":"stan-lemon"},{"name":"star trek","slug":"star-trek"},{"name":"twitter","slug":"twitter"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/episode-31-snow-football-star-trek-and-twitter/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-30-maybe-weezer-should-have-performed-the-super-bowl-halftime-show/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 30 - Maybe Weezer Should have Performed  the Super Bowl Halftime Show"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-32-the-milkshake-that-wasnt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 32 - The Milkshake that Wasn't"}}}},
