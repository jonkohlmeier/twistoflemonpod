Jon spent nearly 2 hours shoveling after the most recent snow storm. Stan asks Jon about snow removal tools and discovers that he finally ordered a snowblower! Somewhere in there we go off on a tangent on Star Trek.</p>\n<p>All weekend Stan was tweeting about the Alliance. Jon learns that this isn’t a World of Warcraft or Firefly reference.. but just more football. Needless to say, Stan is really excited about it.</p>\n<p>We talk about twitter and whether it’s a good platform to have a conversation/interview. #KaraJack.</p>\n<p>Leave a review on iTunes. We’ll read it on air and if you send Stan your address we’ll send a sticker!</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening,</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 31 - Snow, Football, Star Trek and Twitter","date":"February 14, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/031-lwatol-20190214.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":["Home Ownership","Movies","Technology"],"tags":["snowblower","star trek","football"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/episode-31-snow-football-star-trek-and-twitter/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-30-maybe-weezer-should-have-performed-the-super-bowl-halftime-show/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 30 - Maybe Weezer Should have Performed  the Super Bowl Halftime Show"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-32-the-milkshake-that-wasnt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 32 - The Milkshake that Wasn't"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
