That tip alone is worth listening to this episode.</p>\n<p>A new Italian Beef place opened up in Cedar Rapids, I give my review (unfortunately no milkshakes on the menu). Stan describes what an Italian beef is, because apparently they’re kind of a regional thing.</p>\n<p>Stan Lee died this week, we remember the creator of Marvel and spend some time talking about his work.</p>\n<p>I voted… and started more political talk. The episode is saved with a Jon Moving Update. Stan is surviving life and the Lemon house doesn’t appear to be falling apart this week.</p>\n<p>Listen in, have fun, write a review on iTunes: we’ll be talking about some on air next week!</p>\n<p>Talk to you later,</p>\n<p>Jon Kohlmeier\n.mp3/twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/</p>\n<h2>Show notes:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.higherthings.org/podcasts/legacy-cast/episode-186-may-11th-2012/\">The 3am recording of HT Radio on The Avengers (5/11/2012)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://giannasbeef.com\">Gianna’s Italian Beef</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Remembering Stan Lee","date":"November 15, 2018","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/018-lwatol-20181115.mp3 ","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":["Movies"],"tags":["moving","politics","avengers","milkshakes","marvel"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/remembering-stan-lee/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/reformation-voting-and-kanban-moving-boards/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reformation, Voting, and Kanban Moving Boards"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/jon-moved-in/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jon Moved In!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
