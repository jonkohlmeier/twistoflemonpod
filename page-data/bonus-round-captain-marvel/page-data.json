We cover one of the core tenants of the podcast (Milkshakes, Mac, Marvel, and Money) by our review episode on the latest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Captain Marvel!</p>\n<p>This episode is full of spoilers so if you don’t want us to ruin the film for you, you should take this time to leave us a review on iTunes and check back after you see Captain Marvel. More importantly it is full of geekiness, so you don’t want to miss this episode if you’re a Marvel fan.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, we think you should watch this (or watch it again.) And we’re even more excited for Avengers: End Game next month.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening,</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<h2>Show Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/03/08/captain-marvel-rotten-tomatoes-review/\">Review Bombing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/2019/03/05/captain-marvel-reviews-brie-larson/\">Initial Bad Reviews</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Tesseract\">Tesseract</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/09/captain-marvels-cat-goose-what-is-a-flerken-flirken-flurkin-flurken-flurkan\">Goose/Flerkens</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bonus Round: Captain Marvel","date":"March 09, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/b02-lwatol-20190309.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":["Marvel","Movies"],"tags":["avengers","milkshakes","marvel"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bonus-round-captain-marvel/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/stan-visits-iowa/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stan Visits Iowa"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-philisophical-debate-regarding-grilled-cheese/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Philosophical​ Debate regarding Grilled Cheese"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
