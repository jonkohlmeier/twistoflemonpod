For both Game of Thrones and because it’s Holy Week.</p>\n<p>Disney rebased some big announcements that we give our take on. We’re both excited for Disney+ and the content to come with it.</p>\n<p>Which leads directly into the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker teaser discussion. We have a new hope after this teaser.</p>\n<p>Finally Jon asks Stan about his new investing strategy and Stan gives us more information than we could have ever dreamed of.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening in!</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p>P.S.
