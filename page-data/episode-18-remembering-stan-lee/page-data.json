That tip alone is worth listening to this episode.</p>\n<p>A new Italian Beef place opened up in Cedar Rapids, I give my review (unfortunately no milkshakes on the menu). Stan describes what an Italian beef is, because apparently they’re kind of a regional thing.</p>\n<p>Stan Lee died this week, we remember the creator of Marvel and spend some time talking about his work.</p>\n<p>I voted… and started more political talk. The episode is saved with a Jon Moving Update. Stan is surviving life and the Lemon house doesn’t appear to be falling apart this week.</p>\n<p>Listen in, have fun, write a review on iTunes: we’ll be talking about some on air next week!</p>\n<p>Talk to you later,</p>\n<p>Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p>[audio mp3=”<a href=\"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/018-lwatol-20181115.mp3%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/audio%5C%5D\">https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/018-lwatol-20181115.mp3”\\]\\[/audio\\]</a></p>\n<h2>Show notes:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.higherthings.org/podcasts/legacy-cast/episode-186-may-11th-2012/\">The 3am recording of HT Radio on The Avengers (5/11/2012)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://giannasbeef.com\">Gianna’s Italian Beef</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 18 - Remembering Stan Lee","date":"November 15, 2018","enclosure":{"url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/018-lwatol-20181115.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":[{"name":"General","slug":"general"},{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies"}],"tags":[{"name":"chicago","slug":"chicago"},{"name":"comics","slug":"comics"},{"name":"food","slug":"food"},{"name":"marvel","slug":"marvel"},{"name":"movies","slug":"movies"},{"name":"moving","slug":"moving"},{"name":"politics","slug":"politics"},{"name":"stan lee","slug":"stan-lee"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/episode-18-remembering-stan-lee/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-17-reformation-voting-and-kanban-moving-boards/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 17 - Reformation, Voting, and Kanban Moving Boards"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-19-jon-moved-in/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 19 - Jon Moved In!"}}}},
