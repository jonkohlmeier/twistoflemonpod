It went about how you’d expect it to go. We also hit on some other things around Red Robin. We also discovered that there is a Strawberry Milkshake flavored Pop-Tart. Stay tuned for reviews of that.</p>\n<p>Coming off of our sugar high, Stan tells us about his most recent iOS woes. He’s running into trouble locking down screen time for his children’s devices.</p>\n<p>That leads into Adult Screen-time and what Stan has been trying to rush through so he doesn’t have to pay for another month of Netflix.</p>\n<p>Finally we each go through our Top 5 of 2018. Some items include buying houses, starting a podcast, and travel.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening in. We’re still waiting for our first written iTunes review of 2019!</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p>[audio mp3=”<a href=\"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/026-lwatol-20190110.mp3%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/audio%5C%5D\">https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/026-lwatol-20190110.mp3”\\]\\[/audio\\]</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 26 - Starting 2019 and Looking Back on 2018","date":"January 10, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/026-lwatol-20190110.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":[{"name":"General","slug":"general"},{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"technology"}],"tags":[{"name":"2018","slug":"2018"},{"name":"ios","slug":"ios"},{"name":"marvel","slug":"marvel"},{"name":"Milkshake","slug":"milkshake"},{"name":"netflix","slug":"netflix"},{"name":"pop-tart","slug":"pop-tart"},{"name":"screentime","slug":"screentime"},{"name":"top 5","slug":"top-5"},{"name":"twistoflemon","slug":"twistoflemon"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/episode-26-starting-2019-and-looking-back-on-2018/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-25-the-budget-episode/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 25 - The Budget Episode"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-27-milkshake-flavored-pop-tarts-customer-support-and-solo-a-star-wars-story/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 27 - Milkshake Flavored Pop-Tarts, Customer Support, and Solo: A Star Wars Story"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
