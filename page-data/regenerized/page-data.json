Stan and Jon were hanging out, but not recording. You get a small taste of what we did in Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>That kicks off the discussion on the importance of taking a break. Stan yells at Jon for being notoriously bad for this. We talk about how we unwind and mostly ignore work when we aren’t working.</p>\n<p>From there we move on to productivity. Stan reiterates his view of work when you work and don’t work when you’re not working. He draws strong boundaries between different areas of life.</p>\n<p>We break productivity down into 3 things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to decide what to do.</li>\n<li>Deciding when you’re going to do it.</li>\n<li>Handling everything that you’re not going to do.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By definition there can only be one #1 priority. If there’s not you’re running between things and having decided and committed on what to do.</p>\n<p>We dive into how to set priorities and how we do it.</p>\n<p>Finally, Stan gives us an update on his Netflix subscription and what he’s watching.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening,</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Regenerized","date":"December 12, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/074-lwatol-20191212.mp3","length":null,"type":null},"categories":[{"name":"Career Advice","slug":"career-advice"},{"name":"General","slug":"general"},{"name":"Productivity","slug":"productivity"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"technology"}],"tags":[{"name":"jon kohlmeier","slug":"jon-kohlmeier"},{"name":"life with a twist of lemon","slug":"life-with-a-twist-of-lemon"},{"name":"personal development","slug":"personal-development"},{"name":"productivity","slug":"productivity"},{"name":"stan lemon","slug":"stan-lemon"},{"name":"taking a break","slug":"taking-a-break"},{"name":"thanksgiving","slug":"thanksgiving"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/regenerized/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/thanksgiving-2019/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thanksgiving 2019"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/merry-star-warsmas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Merry Star Warsmas"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
