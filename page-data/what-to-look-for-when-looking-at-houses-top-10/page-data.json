The question went something like this: “Top ten things to look at when your Realtor shows you houses… go!” I (Jon) expected a list! 10 Things! But there’s no such thing as a simple question when it comes to Stan. He convinces me to dig up the secondary microphone in the home office and record after 8pm on a Sunday night.</p>\n<p>I think we hit 10 things. I guess that I’ll go back and listen again and see if I can’t turn it into a text list. If you get to it before me feel free to send them via message on our <a href=\"https://facebook.com/twistoflemonpod\">Facebook Page</a>.</p>\n<p>We do review milkshakes from Arby’s and Five Guys. Stan also attempted A &#x26; W. So stick around for you weekly milkshake update.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jon “in-search-of-a-house” Kohlmeier\n.mp3/twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What to look for when looking at Houses (Top 10!)","date":"September 20, 2018","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/010-lwatol-20180919.mp3 ","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":["House Hunting"],"tags":["milkshakes"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/what-to-look-for-when-looking-at-houses-top-10/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bonus-round-stan-needs-a-css-refresher/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"BONUS ROUND - Stan needs a CSS Refresher"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/meat-rubs-new-apple-toys-investing-101/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Meat Rubs, New Apple Toys, Investing 101"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
