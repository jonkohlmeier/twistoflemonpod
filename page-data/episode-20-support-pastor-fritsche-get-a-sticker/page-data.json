We’re looking to support Pastor Joel Fritsche and his work in the Dominican Republic. Here’s the deal, you donate - send us proof of donating $50 or more and we’ll send you a limited edition Life with a Twist of Lemon sticker (3” x 3”).</p>\n<p>Even better is Stan will be matching the first $1000 raised.</p>\n<p>Listen in to hear about the work of Pastor Fritsche with the seminary in the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p>From there Stan has *another* beef with CPH study notes. He rants a little bit. I apologize to our non-LCMS listeners for the inside baseball. Jon calls people out by name… overall it’s a bitter segment. You can skip it if you’d like. (Props to CPH for no more red algae).</p>\n<p>Finally we switch gears to Tech. Stan quit Gmail this week. We talk about Google, security and the evolution of correspondence and email.</p>\n<p>Thanks for tuning in and we hope to be sending you a sticker soon!</p>\n<p>- Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p>[audio mp3=”<a href=\"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/020-lwatol-20181129.mp3%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/audio%5C%5D\">https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/020-lwatol-20181129.mp3”\\]\\[/audio\\]</a></p>\n<h3>Show notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/twistoflemonpod/fritsche\">Learn more about Supporting Pastor Joel Fritsche.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cph.org\">CPH.org</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 20 - Support Pastor Fritsche, get a Sticker.","date":"November 29, 2018","enclosure":{"url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/020-lwatol-20181129.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":[{"name":"General","slug":"general"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"technology"},{"name":"Theology","slug":"theology"}],"tags":[{"name":"advent","slug":"advent"},{"name":"cph","slug":"cph"},{"name":"Fritsche","slug":"fritsche"},{"name":"giving","slug":"giving"},{"name":"gmail","slug":"gmail"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/episode-20-support-pastor-fritsche-get-a-sticker/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-19-jon-moved-in/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 19 - Jon Moved In!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-21-homeownership-woes-milkshakes-and-meatloaf-the-food-not-the-hiphop-artist/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 21 - Homeownership Woes, Milkshakes and Meatloaf (The food, not the hiphop artist)"}}}},
