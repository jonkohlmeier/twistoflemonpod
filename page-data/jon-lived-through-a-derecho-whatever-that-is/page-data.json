Cedar Rapids has lost at least 50% of its tree canopy. The Iowa Twist of Lemon bunker was hit by a tree after straight line winds that reached speeds equivalent to a Category 4 Hurricane. This resulted in Jon being without power for 151 hours. There are still over 20,000 people without power as of posting this episode a week and a half after the storm hit.</p>\n<p>Listen in to hear Jon’s experience during the storm and the week after it hit and start working on his three helpful things to make it through natural disaster.</p>\n<p>1.) Find a friend like Stan Lemon. 2.) Have a sizable emergency fund for the unexpected. 3.) Trust in the Lord who is continually more helpful than governments.</p>\n<p>Recovery will be a long process both at the Iowa bunker and in Eastern Iowa. We’ll keep you updated as we repair and rebuild.</p>\n<p>Finally Stan wants to talk about Fortnite and Apple and the App Store. Jon doesn’t know much about what is going on, but Stan has strong feelings.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t yet please subscribe using your favorite podcast app and we’ll be back next week! (Barring any natural disasters).</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Jon Lived Through a Derecho, whatever that is.","date":"August 20, 2020","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/096-lwatol-20200820.mp3","length":51609615,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":["Home Ownership"],"tags":["apple","derecho","home improvement"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/jon-lived-through-a-derecho-whatever-that-is/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/two-years-with-a-twist-of-lemon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Two Years with a Twist of Lemon"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/goodr-sunglasses-and-home-improvement/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Goodr Sunglasses and Home Improvement"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
