We talk through some reasons in this episode. The big reason ends up being the hymns. (You might even catch Jon singing.) Bottom line is good hymns trump candy.</p>\n<p>In light of next week’s elections, Jon asks Stan how he reasons out who to vote for.</p>\n<p>After that downer - Jon has a milkshake review from Freddy’s Frozen Custard.</p>\n<p>Apple announced new hardware for the iPad Pro, Mac mini, and MacBook Air. Did Stan order anything? Why or why not?</p>\n<p>Listen in, rate us (5 stars) on iTunes, post any complaints on Reddit and we’ll talk to you next week!</p>\n<p>-Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p>[audio mp3=”<a href=\"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/016-lwatol-20181101.mp3%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/audio%5C%5D\">https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/016-lwatol-20181101.mp3”\\]\\[/audio\\]</a></p>\n<h2>Show notes:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ethepeople.org\">E The People</a></li>\n<li>[Apple](<a href=\"https://apple.com\">https://apple.com</a> target=)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/O9VolOFsnPI\">We All Believe in One True God</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/R-pswaKCDW0\">Isaiah Mighty Seer in Days of Old</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://freddysusa.com\">Freddy’s Frozen Custard</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 16 - The Best Podcast you Probably Won't Listen To","date":"November 01, 2018","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/016-lwatol-20181101.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":[{"name":"General","slug":"general"},{"name":"Theology","slug":"theology"}],"tags":[{"name":"apple","slug":"apple"},{"name":"halloween","slug":"halloween"},{"name":"MacBooks","slug":"macbooks"},{"name":"Milkshake","slug":"milkshake"},{"name":"theology","slug":"theology"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/episode-16-the-best-podcast-you-probably-wont-listen-to/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-15-would-sidd-finch-like-marvel-netflix-series-or-milkshakes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 15 - Would Sidd Finch like Marvel Netflix Series (or milkshakes)?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/episode-17-reformation-voting-and-kanban-moving-boards/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Episode 17 - Reformation, Voting, and Kanban Moving Boards"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
