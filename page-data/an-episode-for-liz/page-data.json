We’re not sure when exactly she stopped listening. So this week no Star Wars, Marvel or Salesforce talk. We even talk about a topic specifically requested by Liz.</p>\n<p>Most of Jon’s family came to visit for Labor Day weekend. You’ll get a brief update on that weekend and how Jon handles people as an introvert.</p>\n<p>We discuss why Stan gave Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism only 2 stars (not the 5 that you should give us on iTunes.) Listen in to why Stan went with that review.</p>\n<p>We talk about Stan’s computer woes - specifically around Catalina. Stan is back up and running. Things might even be backed up by now.</p>\n<p>Finally we clear the topic backlog by talking about our work station. Listen in to how Stan and Jon keep up their desks organized and what are regularly on it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Listening!</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p>[audio mp3=”<a href=\"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/061-lwatol-20190905.mp3%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/audio%5C%5D\">https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/061-lwatol-20190905.mp3”\\]\\[/audio\\]</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jon-desk-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Jon’s Workspace</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stan-desk-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Stan’s Workspace</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Episode for Elizabeth","date":"September 05, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/twistoflemonpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/061-lwatol-20190905.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":[{"name":"General","slug":"general"},{"name":"Productivity","slug":"productivity"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"technology"}],"tags":[{"name":"backup","slug":"backup"},{"name":"cal newport","slug":"cal-newport"},{"name":"computer","slug":"computer"},{"name":"desk","slug":"desk"},{"name":"digital minimalism","slug":"digital-minimalism"},{"name":"elizabeth","slug":"elizabeth"},{"name":"family","slug":"family"},{"name":"jon kohlmeier","slug":"jon-kohlmeier"},{"name":"labor day","slug":"labor-day"},{"name":"life with a twist of lemon","slug":"life-with-a-twist-of-lemon"},{"name":"liz","slug":"liz"},{"name":"stan lemon","slug":"stan-lemon"},{"name":"workspace","slug":"workspace"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/an-episode-for-liz/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/use-the-force-to-use-email-better/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Use the Force... to Use Email Better"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/stans-christmas-in-september/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stan's Christmas in September"}}}},
