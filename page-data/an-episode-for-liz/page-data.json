We’re not sure when exactly she stopped listening. So this week no Star Wars, Marvel or Salesforce talk. We even talk about a topic specifically requested by Liz.</p>\n<p>Most of Jon’s family came to visit for Labor Day weekend. You’ll get a brief update on that weekend and how Jon handles people as an introvert.</p>\n<p>We discuss why Stan gave Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism only 2 stars (not the 5 that you should give us on iTunes.) Listen in to why Stan went with that review.</p>\n<p>We talk about Stan’s computer woes - specifically around Catalina. Stan is back up and running. Things might even be backed up by now.</p>\n<p>Finally we clear the topic backlog by talking about our work station. Listen in to how Stan and Jon keep up their desks organized and what are regularly on it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Listening!</p>\n<p>Stan Lemon &#x26; Jon Kohlmeier</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/jon-desk-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Jon’s Workspace</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/stan-desk-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Stan’s Workspace</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Episode for Elizabeth","date":"September 05, 2019","enclosure":{"url":"https://twistoflemonpod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/episodes/061-lwatol-20190905.mp3","length":222,"type":"audio/mpeg"},"categories":["Productivity","Technology"],"tags":["backup","cal newport","computer","desk","digital minimalism","elizabeth","family","jon kohlmeier","labor day","life with a twist of lemon","liz","stan lemon","workspace"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/an-episode-for-liz/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/use-the-force-to-use-email-better/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Use the Force... to Use Email Better"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/stans-christmas-in-september/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stan's Christmas in September"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["110053308","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
