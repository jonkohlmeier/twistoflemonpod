    <p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:00]</p>
<p>Dramas, please.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:13]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:20]</p>
<p>This is life</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:22]</p>
<p>with a twist of lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:25]</p>
<p>Okay. So we're supposed to remind everyone</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:28]</p>
<p>to leave a review on iTunes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:31]</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:32]</p>
<p>Right. Because we usually do that at the end of the episode,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:35]</p>
<p>and if that's the first thing they hear, then maybe they'll do it while they listen to the rest of the episode.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:41]</p>
<p>So listener, if you've made it this far,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:44]</p>
<p>pause,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:45]</p>
<p>go leave a review on iTunes, and if you happen to remember to come back and press play again, that's fine too.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:54]</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:56]</p>
<p><a href="http://Twistoflemonpod.com">Twistoflemonpod.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:59]</p>
<p>What are we on Twitter and Facebook?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:02]</p>
<p>Twistoflemonpod.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:03]</p>
<p>Oh, that's easy to remember.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:07]</p>
<p>Alright, John. You sent me a picture</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:10]</p>
<p>and it looks to me like a lot of snow.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:13]</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:15]</p>
<p>Had I think eight inches of snow</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:17]</p>
<p>when I woke up this morning.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:20]</p>
<p>So eight</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:21]</p>
<p>brand new inches.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:24]</p>
<p>Eight brand new inches.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:26]</p>
<p>How long is your driveway again?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:29]</p>
<p>90 feet.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:31]</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:32]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:33]</p>
<p>you've got a pretty good shovel?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:39]</p>
<p>My shovel is okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:40]</p>
<p>I bought it when I wanted to get out</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:44]</p>
<p>of my apartment parking lot after the snow had drifted back over.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:51]</p>
<p>Okay. So it would fit in my car,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:54]</p>
<p>and it's five years old.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:57]</p>
<p>Does it have a blade on the front of it,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:59]</p>
<p>on the edge?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:01]</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:02]</p>
<p>At this point,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:03]</p>
<p>the edge is kind of chipped as well. So it's not even a real flat edge.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:10]</p>
<p>So you're just struggling to do this, aren't you? Yes. Yes, I am. I did buy How</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:16]</p>
<p>long did it take you today? So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:19]</p>
<p>Anna went out there midday and she did</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:23]</p>
<p>maybe a six of the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:26]</p>
<p>I did the rest,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:27]</p>
<p>after I stopped working for the day</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:30]</p>
<p>and that was it took me an hour and forty five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:36]</p>
<p>So you closed all your rings?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:38]</p>
<p>I closed all my rings.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:41]</p>
<p>I'm currently sitting at</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:43]</p>
<p>almost 200% of my move goal.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:46]</p>
<p>Well, good for you, John. I got forty two minutes of exercise out of that. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:53]</p>
<p>Isn't that amazing? It's gotta be frustrating. Right? You spend an hour and forty five out there and you only get forty two minutes of credit for it. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:01]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:02]</p>
<p>that was my afternoon stand.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:06]</p>
<p>Thankfully, it's not cold outside. I mean, we were just under 30 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:11]</p>
<p>I So came in, and I was drenched in sweat from shoveling for almost two hours.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:16]</p>
<p>How many more days of snowfall are you anticipating</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:20]</p>
<p>I have no the rest of the year? I have no idea, man.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:23]</p>
<p>This winter has been weird.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:26]</p>
<p>So are you hedging your bets? I mean, are are are like, are you gonna stick it out with the shovel, John?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:33]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:34]</p>
<p>I did order a new shovel</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:36]</p>
<p>when I saw that mine was chipping.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:38]</p>
<p>Does that one have a blade?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:40]</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:41]</p>
<p>Okay. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:44]</p>
<p>so that's supposed to come. It was supposed to come today and now delivery date is pushed to Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:50]</p>
<p>I wonder why, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:54]</p>
<p>I don't know, man. I don't think it made it to Iowa yet.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:57]</p>
<p>Did did you leave the house at all today?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:00]</p>
<p>No. Only to go outside and travel.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:02]</p>
<p>Okay. I woke up.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:04]</p>
<p>I was</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:06]</p>
<p>looking at shoveling around</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:08]</p>
<p>05:00 this morning, and our street hadn't been plowed at that point. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:14]</p>
<p>I could have spent the two hours to shovel then,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:18]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:19]</p>
<p>it would have been clear, or I could just come inside and work. So I opted to work from home today along with the rest of my team.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:27]</p>
<p>At any point, did it cross your mind</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:30]</p>
<p>within the last couple of days that, you know, maybe</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:34]</p>
<p>you could go to Walmart and buy a shovel.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:37]</p>
<p>Yes. I went</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:39]</p>
<p>to Lowe's first</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:41]</p>
<p>and looked</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:42]</p>
<p>and they had a couple shovels but not what I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:46]</p>
<p>They did not have any rock salt</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:49]</p>
<p>which you are anti rock salt.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:52]</p>
<p>I I am anti rock salt. Technically</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:55]</p>
<p>rock salt. It is ice melt.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:58]</p>
<p>It's calcium</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:00]</p>
<p>chloride,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:00]</p>
<p>not sodium chloride.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:02]</p>
<p>No matter what it is, it is going to wreak havoc on your concrete. So there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:09]</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:10]</p>
<p>when most failed me, I went right next door to Walmart and they had absolutely</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:16]</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:18]</p>
<p>So what's the moral of this story</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:20]</p>
<p>in your mind? Is it just go to Amazon first or is it</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:25]</p>
<p>I should probably get a shovel</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:27]</p>
<p>before it snows?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:29]</p>
<p>I had a shovel.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:32]</p>
<p>Yeah. But but John, it sounds like the shovel was falling apart.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:36]</p>
<p>Just recently because it's got a lot of uses here.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:40]</p>
<p>And it I just it got</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:42]</p>
<p>me out of my driveway today. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:46]</p>
<p>It just it cracks me up. Right? This is kind of I I don't know if this is just our generation or</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:53]</p>
<p>society as a whole now, but, you know, don't</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:57]</p>
<p>prepare.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:58]</p>
<p>And then when you need something, just stay in your house for a day while you wait for Amazon to deliver whatever it is you need. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:07]</p>
<p>Yeah. Why break my neck when the UPS guy can do it for me? Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:13]</p>
<p>And I ordered this this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:16]</p>
<p>The big snowstorm was supposed to come on Friday originally. Thanks to your dark sky app that we talked about a couple episodes again. And now there's no snow on Friday and lots of snow overnight last night.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:29]</p>
<p>So okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:31]</p>
<p>Do you have do have prime? Did you at least order this prime?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:35]</p>
<p>I did</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:36]</p>
<p>and then they failed me.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:38]</p>
<p>So you didn't like pay for rush delivery or anything?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:42]</p>
<p>No. I wasn't expecting the snow Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:44]</p>
<p>I yeah. I get that John, but I feel like I feel like if you went to all these places and they didn't have a a shovel,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:52]</p>
<p>with the kind of snow that you've had that I might have thought, the $4.99</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:57]</p>
<p>to get it in twenty four hours might just be worth it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:01]</p>
<p>I think I well, first of all, they probably don't deliver in twenty four hours to Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:09]</p>
<p>But secondly,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:12]</p>
<p>my situation wasn't that bad until we got eight inches of wet heavy snow.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:18]</p>
<p>Yeah. Again If it was three inches of snow, it would have been fine. It's all about preparing, John. So, interestingly, if you lived in a real city like Indianapolis,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:28]</p>
<p>Har Har Or Milwaukee, you can get same day Yeah. Two hour delivery. That's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:33]</p>
<p>exactly where I was going with this. Same day delivery. So you could</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:36]</p>
<p>have a private courier deliver</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:39]</p>
<p>a shovel to you assuming that that's one of the same day delivery</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:42]</p>
<p>things. But I I gotta feel like in a pinch,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:46]</p>
<p>you could find</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:47]</p>
<p>the shovel you need. But if you're doing same day delivery for a shovel, you're like, you're already screwed. That courier Right. Is not gonna make it to you. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:55]</p>
<p>Anyway,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:57]</p>
<p>my moral of the story is to go to the Internet first because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:01]</p>
<p>whenever I'm looking for a somewhat specialty item, I. Anything that's not food or</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:07]</p>
<p>something like light bulbs,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:09]</p>
<p>I'm just gonna order it online.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:11]</p>
<p>I I reject your premise that a shovel is a specialty item.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:16]</p>
<p>In February, it is because all the spring stuff's out. If I want a patio furniture,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:21]</p>
<p>that I had in galore or grills if I waited to buy my grill ton now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:28]</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:29]</p>
<p>like, is this is this the end of the story? Are you gonna ride out the season with the shovel, the new shovel when it comes? It probably will not snow after the shovel arrives, but, you know, just in case. Oh, it gets better, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:42]</p>
<p>So this morning,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:44]</p>
<p>when I woke up to all the snow that I didn't wanna shovel and then get into work, so I started working instead.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:51]</p>
<p>I caved</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:53]</p>
<p>and I ordered</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:54]</p>
<p>a snowblower.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:56]</p>
<p>Did you settle on the two stage or did you go single stage? Oh, two stage and after all the all the snow that I shoveled today,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:05]</p>
<p>I am so glad I did.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:07]</p>
<p>Alright. Alright. Well So that should be here next Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:12]</p>
<p>The problem with the snowblower is I would have dug myself out in order to go get this at Lowe's or</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:20]</p>
<p>someplace that had snow blowers because those were still out.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:24]</p>
<p>But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:25]</p>
<p>I never get into my car or out of my car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:29]</p>
<p>Did you say next Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:31]</p>
<p>Next Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:33]</p>
<p>Isn't that's a that's a Star Trek line.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:36]</p>
<p>Alright then.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:38]</p>
<p>Do you do you not know the line I'm referring to?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:41]</p>
<p>I don't. I'm gonna I'm gonna botch this, but in Star Trek generations, if you remember, they take the Enterprise b</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:48]</p>
<p>out for you know, it's maiden voyage, and Kirk and Chekhov and, Scotty are all aboard.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:56]</p>
<p>Right? Right. And they meet the nexus.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:59]</p>
<p>There's a ship in distress.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:01]</p>
<p>Whoopi Goldberg, Ginan, is on it, as well as, what's his name? Sauron?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:06]</p>
<p>Soren? Soren. Doctor Soren.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:09]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:10]</p>
<p>they proceed to go, you know, with a rescue mission. And they they iterate through a list of equipment on the enterprise,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:17]</p>
<p>and the captain</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:19]</p>
<p>says every time that it won't be installed till next Tuesday. So it's like tractor beam won't be installed till next Tuesday. Torpedoes won't be installed till next Tuesday. One down the other. So you're Interesting. I did not remember that. I remember them going out for a bunch of stuff was installed,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:36]</p>
<p>but this just means that I have to watch generations again. You should watch generations again. That's such a great film.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:43]</p>
<p>It's okay. So it What's your favorite what's your favorite non</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:50]</p>
<p>the original series?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:52]</p>
<p>First Contact. Films. It's like First Contact? You have to ask? Yeah. First Contact is probably my favorite of all time because it's probably the first Star Trek movie I ever saw.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:02]</p>
<p>But Really?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:03]</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:11:05]</p>
<p>Because I know that Wrath of Khan</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:11:09]</p>
<p>beats everything for you.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:11]</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, wrath wrath of Khan is the creme de la creme. I think didn't I write a blog article about this?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:11:18]</p>
<p>I did. Star Trek movies? I thought it was Star Wars movies,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:11:22]</p>
<p>but it might have been.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:24]</p>
<p>Oh, you know what? This, maybe this is about</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:28]</p>
<p>TV shows. I don't think I wrote about</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:31]</p>
<p>the movies.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:33]</p>
<p>But yeah. I mean, First Contact</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:36]</p>
<p>is by far my favorite from,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:39]</p>
<p>the Next Generation cast.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:41]</p>
<p>I would say</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:42]</p>
<p>Wrath of Khan trumps that. Where I struggle is where to put,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:48]</p>
<p>undiscovered country in relation to First Contact.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:51]</p>
<p>I tend I tend to lean towards a two eight six</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:55]</p>
<p>breakdown for the top three.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:58]</p>
<p>But on certain days, if you ask me, it might be 268,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:01]</p>
<p>but usually it's 286.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:03]</p>
<p>So You know what this means, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:05]</p>
<p>We have to watch all of the Star Trek movies together? We do. Okay. Not necessarily together, but in relatively same time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:13]</p>
<p>So the question is, can you when you do a Star Trek movie marathon, do you start with the first one?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:20]</p>
<p>So generally,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:21]</p>
<p>skip the first one.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:23]</p>
<p>Yeah. Most people do.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:25]</p>
<p>It's the first one is is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:28]</p>
<p>really hard,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:29]</p>
<p>I think, to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:32]</p>
<p>get into.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:33]</p>
<p>There's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:34]</p>
<p>and it feels like it's a different,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:38]</p>
<p>like, a different storyline altogether. You know? Right. They just did a lousy job, I think, of transitioning from the original series into</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:46]</p>
<p>the motion picture. And then, you know, I I don't think they even tried</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:50]</p>
<p>transitioning from the motion picture to Wrath of Khan. Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:54]</p>
<p>Alright, John. We were not gonna talk about Star Wars. We're talking about your snowblower. Star snowblower comes Tuesday. Star Trek.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:00]</p>
<p>Well, I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:02]</p>
<p>can't believe I did that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:03]</p>
<p>You need to edit that out. I I cannot make this mistake. No. That's staying in to redeem me in the sight of missus Lemon who called me out for making the same mistake early on in our podcasting days. My head is so hurting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:20]</p>
<p>Snowblower comes Tuesday. You broke Jordan McKinley's heart.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:25]</p>
<p>I doubt he listened.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:26]</p>
<p>You said it comes Tuesday, so it will not snow again after Monday.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:31]</p>
<p>That's my prediction.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:32]</p>
<p>Want to know on what's for the year. Because I figure if I have the snowblower,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:37]</p>
<p>if we get hit next year or in two years, I will be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:43]</p>
<p>Were you a boy scout, John?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:45]</p>
<p>I never made it into boy scouts. I was a cub scout through or something like that. Okay. Alright. Well, be prepared. Be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:54]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:55]</p>
<p>it looks like I am probably signing up for</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:59]</p>
<p>either Hulu TV or Sling or something.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:03]</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:04]</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:06]</p>
<p>I found something I really liked watching this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:08]</p>
<p>Oh, is this the thing that you were tweeting about all weekend?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:12]</p>
<p>Yeah. Did you</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:13]</p>
<p>You're talking look it up at least. No. You're talking about the alliance and I thought you're playing World of Warcraft.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:20]</p>
<p>Is that a thing in World of Warcraft? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:22]</p>
<p>I've see, I've never played World of Warcraft, I wouldn't know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:26]</p>
<p>Warcart never talked you into it? That's the reason that higher things started paying me was to pay for my World of Warcraft subscription.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:33]</p>
<p>I I don't think you're supposed to say that on the podcast.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:37]</p>
<p>Hopefully, from the IRS is listening. Good lord.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:41]</p>
<p>They're a nonprofit.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:43]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:44]</p>
<p>So, yeah, the Alliance, it's a new football league,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:48]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:49]</p>
<p>they like, I heard about They</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:51]</p>
<p>call the football league the Alliance?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:54]</p>
<p>Yeah. It's the Alliance of American Football.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:58]</p>
<p>Alright. AAF.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:00]</p>
<p>So so here's the gist.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:03]</p>
<p>They they organized,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:04]</p>
<p>like, guess, about a month ago. Like, this this thing's been moving really fast,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:08]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:09]</p>
<p>it's it's, I would say, semi professional. I think they're trying to play it off as professional.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:14]</p>
<p>But basically, they've got eight teams,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:18]</p>
<p>and they involve a bunch of players either straight out of college or</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:22]</p>
<p>that have not been able to make the, the 52 man roster cut for the NFL.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:27]</p>
<p>It's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:28]</p>
<p>like, by</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:30]</p>
<p>most measures, the rules are exactly like the NFL. The the changes</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:34]</p>
<p>are are very minor, and most people would not even notice.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:38]</p>
<p>The,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:39]</p>
<p>play of game that I saw</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:41]</p>
<p>was pretty fast paced and pretty aggressive and looked pretty professional, to be completely honest with you. So I think the kind of players that they're trying to to get right now</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:52]</p>
<p>are those that might maybe be on the practice squad of a professional team and not get any real snaps. Right? So they're they're good enough to play with other professional players. They're just you know, they didn't make the cut for whatever reason.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:07]</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:08]</p>
<p>one of the things that the alliance did is it structured their contracts such that these players</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:13]</p>
<p>can advance themselves to the NFL pretty easily. So,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:17]</p>
<p>they can be kinda, like, called up, if you will. And and I think that's that's kinda cool. Like, I dig it. So for me, it's just more football. It starts like, the first week started after the Super Bowl. So, you know, like, I I didn't have much of a gap.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:33]</p>
<p>I I'm a little I'm a little annoyed that it's distributed across, like, the NFL network and, I think, TNT,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:40]</p>
<p>and I caught a game on CBS.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:42]</p>
<p>So I need I need something because, you know, that that's not broadcast,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:46]</p>
<p>and and that stinks. But yeah. I don't know. I mean, I'm digging it. They one of the things they did that I thought was really clever there's a lot of you you wouldn't know this, John, because you don't watch football, but there's a lot of contention</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:58]</p>
<p>around booth reviews in the NFL, especially the last year.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:02]</p>
<p>Just</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:03]</p>
<p>there's this guy in New York, Al Rivaran,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:06]</p>
<p>who</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:07]</p>
<p>generally makes calls people don't like. We'll just leave it at that. And So this is kinda like instant instant replay in baseball.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:15]</p>
<p>Yeah. It's it's similar, but so there are there are points in football in which everything goes to a booth review. So,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:22]</p>
<p>regardless,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:23]</p>
<p>like, certain play types go to the booth review.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:26]</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if there's been a challenge or not. It's, like, within the two minute warning. Right? Everything goes to the booth review.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:32]</p>
<p>And the intention is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:35]</p>
<p>to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:37]</p>
<p>kinda give more honest,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:39]</p>
<p>like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:41]</p>
<p>calls to the plays.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:42]</p>
<p>Right? Because the the game intensity gets up. You you as you're in those those final moments,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:48]</p>
<p>you know, or say during a turnover</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:50]</p>
<p>where maybe your refs can't keep up with the players. There's there's, like, a whole bunch of circumstances. Right? But the thing is the there's not a lot of transparency of what happens,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:59]</p>
<p>and the alliance</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:01]</p>
<p>actually broadcasts</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:03]</p>
<p>the entire booth review. So you get to see the full conversation between the booth review and the field judge. And I like it. It's pretty cool. Like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:12]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:14]</p>
<p>appreciated the transparency. It made the game a little more interesting to me.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:19]</p>
<p>So, you know, we'll see. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:22]</p>
<p>you did you ever get into, like, WWE or any of that?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:26]</p>
<p>Like, as a middle schooler.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:29]</p>
<p>Okay. So do you remember this is you probably have no idea what I'm gonna say here. Do you remember the XFL?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:36]</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:38]</p>
<p>Oh. I don't remember why,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:40]</p>
<p>but that it was like arena football, wasn't it? No. Gosh. No. No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:46]</p>
<p>No. No. I mean, was it was</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:48]</p>
<p>on field football</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:49]</p>
<p>designed to be</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:52]</p>
<p>like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:54]</p>
<p>the the the brand was to be competitive with the NFL. I wouldn't say that the teams were competitive with the NFL.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:01]</p>
<p>But they</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:02]</p>
<p>removed some rules. They kinda, like, made the game a little harder hitting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:09]</p>
<p>They</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:09]</p>
<p>did some interesting things with cameras.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:13]</p>
<p>I think if if you recall Oh, there was like this bird's eye one. Right? Yeah. Exactly. That stuff didn't exist in the NFL before the XFL. Now the XFL only lasted a season, but it it changed the game. It changed the NFL,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:26]</p>
<p>I think, for the better.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:27]</p>
<p>And I'm I'm kinda hoping that the alliance will do that. Right? I think a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:33]</p>
<p>minor league system that's not college</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:35]</p>
<p>has a lot of appeal to it. Yep. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:38]</p>
<p>if if this is successful, like, again, it's more football for me, so I'm I'm on board.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:44]</p>
<p>Football makes lots of money.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:46]</p>
<p>Yeah. Makes it makes lots of money. I've got a couple of questions.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:50]</p>
<p>Alright. Go for it. Number one,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:52]</p>
<p>have they done anything to address the concussion issue?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:56]</p>
<p>They so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:59]</p>
<p>they have, if I recall, an outside,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:03]</p>
<p>like, evaluation</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:05]</p>
<p>doctor or or group of doctors or something to that effect.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:08]</p>
<p>Whereas today in the NFL, if I recall,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:11]</p>
<p>teams have their own people</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:13]</p>
<p>reviewing players on the sideline, which has been like a point of contention. Right? Because if you're employed, say, by the Dallas cowboys,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:21]</p>
<p>and the Dallas cowboys are down and your quarterback</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:24]</p>
<p>has a potential concussion.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:26]</p>
<p>Right? The the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:27]</p>
<p>the,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:29]</p>
<p>encouragement is going to be to get that player back on the field. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:32]</p>
<p>that,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:33]</p>
<p>is a change. If I recall right too,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:36]</p>
<p>they are not doing,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:39]</p>
<p>a kickoff.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:40]</p>
<p>And instead, I believe they just start from the 25 yard line, which is basically a touchback.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:46]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:47]</p>
<p>part of the thinking there too is, again, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:49]</p>
<p>a kickoff, as exciting as it is, has got some seriously hard hits. Right. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:56]</p>
<p>they're I think</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:57]</p>
<p>they're taking it</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:59]</p>
<p>a little more front and center</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:01]</p>
<p>than the NFL is. So, you know, I whether or not it, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:07]</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:08]</p>
<p>makes the game safer, I I don't know. We'll we'll see.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:11]</p>
<p>Alright. Second question, two parts. Is there a national anthem,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:16]</p>
<p>and do people stand for it?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:19]</p>
<p>I did not see a national anthem in the broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:22]</p>
<p>I have</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:24]</p>
<p>no idea</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:25]</p>
<p>if they do it, so I don't know if they stand or sit. It was not part of the broadcast that I saw.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:32]</p>
<p>I I think</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:33]</p>
<p>so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:34]</p>
<p>if I recall right,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:36]</p>
<p>the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:37]</p>
<p>and and somebody's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:39]</p>
<p>gonna tell me if I'm wrong. But I I thought that the US military actually paid as a sponsorship for the national anthems that get played and broadcast. Like, there's there's that element to it. That's like the NFL didn't used to do that. Maybe they do free now, but there was definitely, like, a post 09:11,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:55]</p>
<p>ad campaign that got that going. My guess is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:59]</p>
<p>that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:00]</p>
<p>the alliance either does it and doesn't broadcast it so that it's not, like, a thing or just doesn't do it at all to avoid</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:08]</p>
<p>that being a thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:10]</p>
<p>It it's a I I think they're probably just trying to avoid</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:15]</p>
<p>any kind of controversy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:17]</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe next week they'll have one, but I I didn't see one this week.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:20]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:22]</p>
<p>That's all the questions I have for today. Easy. So any chance that you'll watch the alliance?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:29]</p>
<p>I doubt that there's any way that I can stand</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:32]</p>
<p>unless they're gonna put it on Amazon Prime. Or</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:35]</p>
<p>I so some games have been on CBS,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:38]</p>
<p>and that's like And I have to hook up my antenna then. Yeah. You should. You totally should.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:44]</p>
<p>So so think about it this way. The I think everybody has the same standardized contract in the alliance. I think it's, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:51]</p>
<p>$250</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:52]</p>
<p>or whatever, which is nothing in the football world. Right? But I think what's kinda cool about that is these players are on an even playing field</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:02]</p>
<p>in terms like, the the money part of it is doesn't appear to be a thing, and I think that that's kinda nice. They're not getting, you know, ripped off like college kids who</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:12]</p>
<p>Right. Make the schools a ton of money. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:16]</p>
<p>But they're</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:17]</p>
<p>they're also, you know, not not doing ridiculous stuff like, you know, Antonio Brown on my team or Levy on Bell on my team, but whatever.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:27]</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:29]</p>
<p>Alright. Well, keep me updated. Tell me if it's more interesting than the NFL, but you like both, so I'll take whatever you say with a grain of salt.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:38]</p>
<p>So I I would say that one of my dilemmas is I I want a team to root for.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:43]</p>
<p>They,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:44]</p>
<p>all almost all the teams are</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:46]</p>
<p>actually, I think they're all in the South,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:49]</p>
<p>and, they</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:50]</p>
<p>largely targeted cities that do not have</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:54]</p>
<p>an NFL team. I think there are two exceptions to that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:57]</p>
<p>But, you know, by and large, there are cities without NFL teams.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:01]</p>
<p>And I don't know if Cedar Rapids wasn't one of them because we have no fan base that would support them. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:08]</p>
<p>Now listen to this, though. Atlanta, Georgia, so that that's that's one that has NFL team. Right? Although Right. Most people I know from Atlanta</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:16]</p>
<p>have disowned their football team, so there is that. K. Birmingham,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:20]</p>
<p>Alabama, which I would not have guessed them big enough to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:24]</p>
<p>Right. Have professional population is now that you say that. Yeah. I I don't know. We could we could look that up. I actually think that Birmingham,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:32]</p>
<p>unless they have some sports team I don't know about, might be the only</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:36]</p>
<p>one of these cities that doesn't have</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:39]</p>
<p>or or metro areas that does not have a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:43]</p>
<p>like another sports team. I just can't think of what what they would have.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:49]</p>
<p>It looks like the 2010 census puts Birmingham at 212,000</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:54]</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:56]</p>
<p>Got it. Alright. Memphis, Tennessee</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:59]</p>
<p>Orlando,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:00]</p>
<p>Florida</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:01]</p>
<p>Tempe, Arizona</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:03]</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, Utah</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:05]</p>
<p>San Antonio, Texas and San Diego, California. So Tempe, Arizona being the other one</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:11]</p>
<p>with a professional sports team nearby because I think,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:15]</p>
<p>unless I'm mistaken,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:18]</p>
<p>Tempe is pretty close to Phoenix, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:24]</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:25]</p>
<p>How does feel like a map? We live too far north. We do. Is. Okay. Alright. So Phoenix Metropolitan Area,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:32]</p>
<p>that would be the other other team that has an NFL franchise nearby.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:37]</p>
<p>So I don't know. I I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:40]</p>
<p>I might pick a team at some point to kinda, like, root for, I guess, just because it'll make it more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:46]</p>
<p>But I can tell you it won't be Tennessee because they looked terrible.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:49]</p>
<p>They're the closest one to you. Right? Yeah. They would be. They would be. I actually thought Birmingham,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:55]</p>
<p>man. Birmingham. They</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:57]</p>
<p>I mean, they looked they looked pretty good. I enjoyed watching them play. So we'll see. The other team that really bombed out was Orlando, the Orlando Apollos.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:06]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:07]</p>
<p>would have guessed something Disney.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:10]</p>
<p>That that'd be a good sponsorship opportunity for them for sure. Like the Orlando Magic?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:16]</p>
<p>Yeah. There you go. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:22]</p>
<p>you're the social media guru. Did you spend any time on Twitter today?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:27]</p>
<p>Only to post things.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:31]</p>
<p>So did you catch any of the Kara Jack hashtag?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:35]</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:36]</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:38]</p>
<p>No. Oh my gosh, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:41]</p>
<p>You know who Kara Swisher is?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:45]</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:46]</p>
<p>Alright. Well, this this isn't going very well.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:49]</p>
<p>Let me let me try something else. Do you know who Jack Dorsey is?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:53]</p>
<p>Name sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:55]</p>
<p>Oh my word. Alright. Do you know who Walt Mossberg is? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:59]</p>
<p>Okay. There we go. We got a we got a starting point.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:03]</p>
<p>Do you remember what Walt's,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:05]</p>
<p>first, like, publication</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:07]</p>
<p>was?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:10]</p>
<p>Not off the top of my head. All things digital. Right? It was a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:14]</p>
<p>component of the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:16]</p>
<p>He did that with Kara Swisher. She was his partner in crime.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:20]</p>
<p>They started a little publication called Recode</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:24]</p>
<p>or Recode Decode.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:26]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:27]</p>
<p>then, you know, Recode was, I I think acquired by Vox, that's when Walt went over the verge yada yada yada. Kara still does</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:34]</p>
<p>reporting for Recode.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:36]</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:37]</p>
<p>is the founder and current CEO of Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:41]</p>
<p>Right. That's why I know the name. Okay. You should be embarrassed, John. I should be, but I'm not in social media anymore, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:49]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:50]</p>
<p>So they,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:52]</p>
<p>had like a a interview</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:54]</p>
<p>on Twitter,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:56]</p>
<p>and it was a mess.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:58]</p>
<p>They'd like it was a ninety minute</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:01]</p>
<p>back and forth. Cara would ask Jack a question. He would respond, and then Cara would like jump the gun and ask another question before Jack was done because he had to reply like, you know, six tweets deep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:12]</p>
<p>It was kinda interesting to watch it play out because I I was I found myself wondering,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:18]</p>
<p>do most people view Twitter as a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:21]</p>
<p>venue for conversation or just a venue for consumption,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:25]</p>
<p>like news digesting?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:28]</p>
<p>So what you're describing sounds</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:31]</p>
<p>kind of like a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:34]</p>
<p>Twitter chat</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:35]</p>
<p>on a smaller scale. Have you seen those around? I think that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:39]</p>
<p>Luther Church Missouri Senate puts out an education one, like, the first Tuesday of every month.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:44]</p>
<p>I have I have no idea what that is, but it sounds maybe like it's related. So and buffer buffer used to do one on Wednesdays too where they had a topic, and then somebody would facilitate it, and they'd have questions.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:57]</p>
<p>And then, like, hey. If you're responding to question one, put</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:02]</p>
<p>a one in your answer for answer number one.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:05]</p>
<p>So I I've seen this before.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:07]</p>
<p>It sounds terrible. Like It is. I don't get how do you how do you follow along?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:12]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:13]</p>
<p>I have no idea, man.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:16]</p>
<p>The only way that I could sort through the chaos was to follow Kara and Jack.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:23]</p>
<p>Let Twitter, like, refresh with all of it and, you know,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:26]</p>
<p>just</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:28]</p>
<p>find out where it began and kinda, like, scroll my way up. The the problem was</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:33]</p>
<p>they they did try to thread at some time,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:36]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:37]</p>
<p>it was I I don't know. Very hard.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:39]</p>
<p>But it's odd because I don't think of Twitter as a, like, a chat</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:44]</p>
<p>system. That's I don't think of it for a conversation is more than a single reply.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:50]</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:52]</p>
<p>Did they include</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:53]</p>
<p>a hashtag</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:55]</p>
<p>in Yeah. Everything they did? Yeah. Yeah. That meant half the Internet. So, like, you couldn't even follow the hashtag.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:02]</p>
<p>You</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:03]</p>
<p>had that peanut gallery, you know, using the hashtag throughout the whole thing. So it was very difficult to follow. I'm I'm really actually kinda hoping that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:11]</p>
<p>they compile some kinda transcript and post it to the Recode site. Because I think there's probably interesting questions</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:17]</p>
<p>being asked and interesting answers being given, but, you know, making heads or tail of it is just very difficult.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:24]</p>
<p>So back in the day, you utilized the Twitter API</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:28]</p>
<p>to create this app called Twitter Paint.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:32]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:33]</p>
<p>Yeah. I think that if Twitter still allowed you to use those things, you could probably filter it down,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:40]</p>
<p>look at only the hashtag from these people, and display it in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:46]</p>
<p>But Yeah. Twitter locked down all its developer stuff, didn't they?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:50]</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, there there are certain credentials exposed. So the idea of a Twitter page, right, was to,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:55]</p>
<p>like, fully thread a discussion</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:58]</p>
<p>in into a full blown</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:01]</p>
<p>limitless depth tree,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:04]</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:05]</p>
<p>thinking being that you could, you know, actually follow</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:09]</p>
<p>and exchange.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:11]</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:14]</p>
<p>that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:15]</p>
<p>that actually works in practice anymore because I don't think people are that careful with threading. Right. Do you do you think they're that careful with threading? Nope.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:24]</p>
<p>Not at all. The</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:25]</p>
<p>other thing is this conversation lasted for ninety minutes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:29]</p>
<p>Oh, Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:30]</p>
<p>That would be a long, huge</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:33]</p>
<p>tree</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:34]</p>
<p>to render. Like, they scheduled this ahead of time. They advertised that it was gonna happen so people could follow it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:41]</p>
<p>You know, like, there's there's a a bunch of Why didn't they just</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:46]</p>
<p>tweet out a video?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:48]</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:50]</p>
<p>I I think they</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:52]</p>
<p>I don't know. That's You know what, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:55]</p>
<p>Because if they just did that, we would not be talking about it right now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:59]</p>
<p>I mean, that could be.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:01]</p>
<p>Jack did seem to acknowledge that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:04]</p>
<p>that was a aspect of the the that the platform, I I think that's I think you used that word, needed to get better at. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:12]</p>
<p>I I don't know. I I just I was really taken aback by the idea of having a ninety minute discussion</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:18]</p>
<p>on Twitter. I it's not something that would have even crossed my mind. I think the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:23]</p>
<p>I see I don't use the normal Twitter client client. Right? I use tweet bot and it I it probably</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:28]</p>
<p>I don't think it refreshes as fast as the Twitter client. So Mhmm. Usually not the streaming API is deprecated.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:33]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:35]</p>
<p>I just can't I can't imagine being patient enough to have that exchange.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:32:41]</p>
<p>Yeah. If you're gonna be having a conversation for</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:32:46]</p>
<p>ninety minutes, it should probably be done in person no matter who you are or what for what purpose.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:52]</p>
<p>Well, at at the very least, vocally. Right? Not necessarily physically in person, but like this exchange is probably acceptable,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:59]</p>
<p>maybe.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:00]</p>
<p>If we went ninety minutes, I would be bored.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:03]</p>
<p>Why would you be bored? We could go ninety minutes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:06]</p>
<p>Yeah. Challenge accepted, John. Have we ever talked for ninety minutes when not in person?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:13]</p>
<p>We've definitely rounded out an hour. I don't know if we've done ninety minutes but Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:18]</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:20]</p>
<p>Again, challenge accepted. We'll we'll make that happen.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:23]</p>
<p>Ninety</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:24]</p>
<p>minute episode</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:25]</p>
<p>of Life with a Twist of Lemon. I have to break it into three parts. Hey, I can utilize podcast chapters.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:32]</p>
<p>There you go. That'd be fancy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:35]</p>
<p>So did you wanna talk about resumes? You had this on the list.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:39]</p>
<p>We can talk about it some other time. I just saw that you had updated your resume.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:44]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:46]</p>
<p>Yeah. I guess I I pushed up on GitHub so you saw the the latest and greatest.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:51]</p>
<p>Every time you make a change, I get an email.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:54]</p>
<p>Do you really? No. Not for that repo.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:57]</p>
<p>That would have been that would have been really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:01]</p>
<p>I have I have interestingly pushed up something to GitHub for you.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:05]</p>
<p>I continue to kinda mess with it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:07]</p>
<p>Yeah. It's probably more complicated than it needs to be but it at some point I need to show it to you. Nice. If I ever make it out there. I need to set</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:15]</p>
<p>aside some time and work on</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:18]</p>
<p>learning react.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:20]</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. You do, John. That's a great technology, man. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:25]</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:26]</p>
<p>I think I know how I would direct you to get started.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:31]</p>
<p>You gave me like my first three</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:33]</p>
<p>tasks that I'm supposed to do. I just have not touched it. Did you write them down?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:39]</p>
<p>No. I put them in Microsoft to do which I recently switched Why</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:45]</p>
<p>did you switch over?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:47]</p>
<p>Because you told me to check it out again. So I do still have Wunderless installed on all my things, but this week,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:54]</p>
<p>I have been using to do exclusively.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:56]</p>
<p>Did you haven't gotten missus not yet. Okay. She's anti</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:35:01]</p>
<p>Microsoft accounts,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:35:02]</p>
<p>so that's the next hurdle I gotta get over.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:35:05]</p>
<p>Don't know why she's anti Microsoft accounts. I think it has something to do with her always using it at school.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:35:12]</p>
<p>I I don't like, she knows that Wunderlist is open or owned by Owned by Microsoft. Yeah. But she doesn't need a personal live account to do that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:21]</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:22]</p>
<p>it's not like it's just a username and password. It's not the end of the world. That's what I'm saying.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:28]</p>
<p>I figured she listened to this podcast I could like She listened to the first three episodes. Oh,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:34]</p>
<p>first three. There you go. We're on what? 31 now?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:38]</p>
<p>I believe, yeah. This is 31.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:40]</p>
<p>Nice. You know, it's it's funny. I as as a young whippersnapper,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:45]</p>
<p>I rejected</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:46]</p>
<p>everything Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:48]</p>
<p>And maybe it's because I'm old now. I don't know. But I've come full circle,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:52]</p>
<p>and I I use Microsoft products all the time. Right? I use I don't I do not use Apple's Pages,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:58]</p>
<p>Numbers, or Keynote.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:00]</p>
<p>I use the Microsoft, you know,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:02]</p>
<p>Office Suite.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:03]</p>
<p>I actually use Microsoft for my email,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:06]</p>
<p>and I've started to dabble a little bit with their calendar product, but I'm still I've got a calendar I share with missus Lemon. I don't I don't really envision that changing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:16]</p>
<p>But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:36:19]</p>
<p>Yeah. So do you use the web interface for email?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:36:23]</p>
<p>Or do you just use their email service in whatever your favorite email app is these days?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:29]</p>
<p>Yeah. So not I don't normally use the web interface. I do occasionally</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:35]</p>
<p>log on to it for, I don't know, whatever reason. Like, tip so as an example, right, like, let's say I'm traveling for work and I wanna check my personal email. I only take one laptop with me, so I would log on through the web that way.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:50]</p>
<p>On the Mac,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:51]</p>
<p>I use mail</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:53]</p>
<p>currently.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:54]</p>
<p>Every so often, I do open up Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:58]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:59]</p>
<p>mostly like it. I think that the thing I struggle with is all of my contacts</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:03]</p>
<p>are in</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:05]</p>
<p>the macOS</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:06]</p>
<p>address book,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:07]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:08]</p>
<p>the Outlook app really doesn't do a great job of I I I don't even I don't think it pulls anything in from there. So it's got, like, its own address book. And that Right. That's a real problem for me because I don't like, I am not getting away</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:21]</p>
<p>from the Apple address book. I'm not getting away from iCloud syncing those addresses.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:26]</p>
<p>I share those with missus Lemon. Like, that's it's too much of a of a important thing</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:31]</p>
<p>to make a change.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:33]</p>
<p>I do, on the iPhone,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:35]</p>
<p>use Outlook,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:37]</p>
<p>and I love it. So Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:37:42]</p>
<p>You're</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:37:43]</p>
<p>surprising every day, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:37:46]</p>
<p>What would your old friends say?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:48]</p>
<p>I don't know. I mean, that that's the thing. Right? Like, I was I was so anti Microsoft for so long, but here's another thing I I use every day that's Microsoft now that I sit here and think about it. I use Microsoft Visual Studio Code for most of my coding</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:01]</p>
<p>that I do, and that's, you know, like, I'm all in on that. That's that's Microsoft's product.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:09]</p>
<p>I I think they're doing good things, like, in general. They're You know, it's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:14]</p>
<p>hard not to touch Microsoft these days too, because, like, I I'm on GitHub all the time. Right. And they own GitHub. They they own LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:22]</p>
<p>I I think their direction's generally pretty good. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:38:27]</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:28]</p>
<p>Alright. No more Google for me, though.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:38:31]</p>
<p>No Google because Google is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:38:34]</p>
<p>Skynet.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:35]</p>
<p>Are are we gonna like, are are are you telling me that next week,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:39]</p>
<p>episode 32,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:41]</p>
<p>is the resume episode? Because you had this written down. Is that what you wanna talk about?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:46]</p>
<p>Unless something better comes up. Okay. Alright. So unless something better comes up, we'll talk about the do's and don'ts of a resume,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:55]</p>
<p>and I guess you're gonna have some questions. Is that the gist? That's why you brought this up? Sure.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:39:00]</p>
<p>I'll come up with questions.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:02]</p>
<p>Alright. We got a plan. In the meantime, if you're still listening, if you made it this far,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:07]</p>
<p>go to iTunes,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:09]</p>
<p>leave a review,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:11]</p>
<p>for Life With a Twisted Lemon. Remember, only five stars, anything less, and you can just close that app because it doesn't belong on iTunes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:19]</p>
<p>Because it belongs on Reddit. There you go. And if you leave a written review, we will read it on air. We will and we will give you props. Actually, you know what we could do, John? We still have some leftover stickers.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:39:31]</p>
<p>Maybe if Send send them stickers.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:33]</p>
<p>Yeah. If you leave a review and you let me know your address,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:37]</p>
<p>you'll have to figure out how to get a hold of me. But if you leave a review and you let me know your address, I'll send you a life of the twist of lemon sticker. How's that?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:44]</p>
<p>That is that shameless? It's gotta be a five star review though.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:39:49]</p>
<p>Right. Five stars. No vulgarity because we need to keep her clean rating.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:54]</p>
<p>Yeah. I don't I don't even know. Like, what would happen if you posted something vulgar on iTunes? Surely that wouldn't make it page. Probably not.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:02]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:03]</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, John, we'll we'll see if anybody takes a step on that. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:40:06]</p>
<p>Sounds good. Till next time. Oh. Till next time. Talk to you later.</p>
