    <p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan and Jon reflect on the Super Bowl that Jon didn't watch. Jon is happy that now everyone thinks that football is as boring as he thought for years.</p>
<p>National Pizza day is Saturday February 9th. You'll want to listen to this discussion to learn Stan's secrets to delicious pizza.</p>
<p>Finally, this week Jon listened to Weezer and convinced Stan to listen as well. We talk the Blue Album and the Teal album.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
<p>P.S. - Jon's audio quality is terrible. We'll get it fixed.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have to listen to the show to leave a review. You don't have to listen to the show to give it 5 stars. In fact, if you don't listen you're more likely to give it 5 stars!&quot; - Stanley C. Lemon.</p>
