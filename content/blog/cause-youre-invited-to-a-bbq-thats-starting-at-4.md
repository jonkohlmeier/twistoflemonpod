Dear Listener,

Stan has dubbed this our "summertime episode". We start off talking all things BBQ. Stan got a new smoker and Jon has been using his to smoke new and exciting things. We talk about the Treager and pork shoulders and chicken wings.

Jon also helped Stan pick out a new mower. He had some trouble with the first one, but was able to exchange it for a mower that everyone can be happy with.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
