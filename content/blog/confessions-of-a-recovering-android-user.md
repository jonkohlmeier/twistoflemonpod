Dear Listener,

This week we are joined by long time listener and first time guest, Daniel Sanchez. Danchez talks about his long journey through Android phones and how he ended up with going with the iPhone 12 most recently.

If you're missing your weekly dose of Marvel, stick around after the credits.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
