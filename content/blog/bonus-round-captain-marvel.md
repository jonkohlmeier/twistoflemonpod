Dear Listener,

We're back with a special bonus round episode of Life with a Twist of Lemon. We cover one of the core tenants of the podcast (Milkshakes, Mac, Marvel, and Money) by our review episode on the latest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Captain Marvel!

This episode is full of spoilers so if you don't want us to ruin the film for you, you should take this time to leave us a review on iTunes and check back after you see Captain Marvel. More importantly it is full of geekiness, so you don't want to miss this episode if you're a Marvel fan.

Needless to say, we think you should watch this (or watch it again.) And we're even more excited for Avengers: End Game next month.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
