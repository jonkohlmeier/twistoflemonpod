Dear Listener,

Thanks for tuning in again this week. We start off the episode talking about Kansas. Stan doesn't back down from Kansas being "nowhere" as he shares his definition of nowhere. We discuss how there are things to do in Kansas, just nothing that Stan would want to do.. except visit a presidential library.

We have a life tip this week from Stan - Don't stop at roundabouts. There's a lot of anger behind this life tip. Listen in, take it to heart and don't do anything stupid.

We have a minimalist tip again this week. Today we focus on the wallet. Jon cleans out his wallet as Stan talks about what little he carries on him.

Finally, you can hear what we said about Game 7 of the World Series just before it aired. Turns out the good guys won!

Thanks for listening,

If you have any topics that you'd like us to cover, let us know on social media or through our contact form.
