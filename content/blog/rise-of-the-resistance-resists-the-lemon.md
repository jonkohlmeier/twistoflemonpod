Dear Listener,

Stan isn't doing so hot, so we apologize for his coughing.

He did survive his week in Disney World, but by Thursday his feet were the least of his concern. He talks about Galaxy's Edge and all things that he was able to experience.

The shoes didn't work out as well as they could have.

We also talk about Picard briefly to close out the episode.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
