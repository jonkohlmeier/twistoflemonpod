Dear Listener,

This week we kick off the episode with some banter about iCloud Drive and Jon's most recent self-reliance achievement.

The bulk of the episode is our review of the the 2016 Hamilton recording that was released on Disney+. We tell you the good, the bad, and why you should probably watch even if you don't think that you'd enjoy it.

Thanks for listening. If you have friends who like Hamilton share this episode with them!

Thanks,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
