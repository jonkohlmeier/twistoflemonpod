Dear Listener,

This week Stan wants to discuss how he goes through life - setting and keeping personal and household rules. Listen in to what types of rules he sets, how he uses them, and what they protect him from.

Then we talk about the 3rd Episode of Hawkeye and the state of Marvel TV shows so far.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
