Dear Listener,

This week, we talk life hacks and pets stories. The episode kicks off with a life hack from a regular listener, keeping a Coozie inside a cargo short pocket. Other life hacks include always having a bottle opener with you and carrying a pocket knife.

We also talk about adventures in pet ownership.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
