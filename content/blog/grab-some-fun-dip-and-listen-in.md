Dear Listener,

We kick off the episode talking about Fun Dip and flashing back to Valentine's Day (perks of being the spouse of an elementary school teacher).

Jon gives his review of TenderShack the new-ish offering on Door Dash and we end the episode talking about the WandaVision episode that Stan told us more about than the actual episode did.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
