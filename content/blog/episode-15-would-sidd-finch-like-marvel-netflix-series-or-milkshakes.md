Dear Listener,

If you're sick of milkshake talk skip the first 3.5 minutes. From there we rejoice in our first iTunes written review AND the first great mystery of Life with a Twist of Lemon.

Jon used the Meat Rubs by Fenker that he received in the mail and gives his review.

Bad news for Netflix / Marvel Fans. Stan and Jon discuss the cancellation of Luke Cage and Iron Fist.

Jon gives an update on the House Hunt.

Finally - Stan suggests a book for Jon to read: "Creative Selection." A book that Stan says is one of the best books in technology. Jon also wants to make a look at "It doesn't have to be crazy at work."

Thanks for listening - leave a review and we just might talk about you too!

\- Jon Kohlmeier
