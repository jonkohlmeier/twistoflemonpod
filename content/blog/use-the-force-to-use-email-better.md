Dear Listener,

Stan spent the week in Atlanta so Jon wasn't sure if they were going to have anything to talk about. Jon planned a couple items of discussion but then all the news dropped out of D23 (which you may or may not care about, but we do.)

We're excited about Ewan McGregor's return to the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The upcoming Mandalorian series. We touch on some other D23 announcements.

Next up we talk about The Rise of Skywalker trailer that dropped this week. Stan didn't get rick-rolled like he was expecting, but overall the trailer doesn't tell us much about the movie.

Then we get to one of Jon's topics - Email best practices.  
Some highlights:

- Use an appropriate Subject Line
- Respond within one business day.
- Make clear requests for next actions
- Your email should be highly skim-able.
- Don't add too many people to the email.

Listen in and share some of your email tips!

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
