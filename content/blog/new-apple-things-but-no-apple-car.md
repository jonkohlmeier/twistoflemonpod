Dear Listener,

This week we cover listener suggested topic of vehicles. Neither Stan nor Jon enjoy buying vehicles but we talk about what comes to mind.

Then we catch up on all things Apple that have been announced and released over the last couple of weeks. New tech, new OS features and more. Listen in for our takes on the newest.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
