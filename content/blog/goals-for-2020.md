Dear Listener,

Happy 2020! We kick of this episode recapping what our 2019 goals/resolutions were. Stan went back to listen to what we talked about a year ago.

Jon appears to have crushed his goals while Stan was non-committal in setting any. He did read 40 books this year and he paid off his mortgage.

For 2020 -

Jon plans to read at least 5 days a week and draw better boundaries between work and personal time.

Stan is sitting in a pretty good spot. Perhaps his resolution is to have less strong opinions. He also might try to get on the bike some more. Jon suggests that he writes more.

We hope that you have a great 2020.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
