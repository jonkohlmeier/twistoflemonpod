Dear Listener,

Today we do a mid-year-ish check in on our goals for 2021 that we set back in [Episode 115: Headed into a New Year](https://twistoflemonpod.com/headed-into-a-new-year/).

Overall we're doing okay on our goals. Hopefully only to improve as the year continues.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
