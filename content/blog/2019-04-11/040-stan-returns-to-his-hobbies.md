Dear Listener,

Happy 40th episode! (Depending on how you count.) We're also celebrating 1 year of Stan and the Lemon family in his house. Stan offers his advice for someone who's only been in a new house for half the time he's been in his.

Stan is back on the bicycle! His bike is all tuned up and he's working on getting his endurance back up. Jon crossed the 1000 mile mark on the bike that he got last year.

Stan also returned to his hobby of grilling. He grilled up his chicken tacos which is one of Jon's favorite recipes. Stan is also considering purchasing a smoker.

One of the core tenants of the podcast is Milkshakes. When Jon ran into a Milkshake IPA, he couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it.

Finally we have some Technology updates from this year. Jon talks about his experiences with Dark Sky and Mint.

Stan talks a little bit about Google and why he actively avoids using Google products.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
