Dear Listener,

The world didn't end as we speculated it might while recording last week. We touch on the inauguration before jumping into WandaVision Episode 3.

There were some big turns during episode 3, but still stuck with the same format. Stan and Jon are both interested to see where it goes.

Thanks for listening, If you like what you hear please share with a friend.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
