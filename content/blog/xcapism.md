Dear Listener,

Stan got an Xbox, Jon is still waiting for his. Stan has been flying around in a Tie Fighter in the meantime. Hopefully Jon will have his by the end of the year, if Amazon comes through.

We touch on the election a little bit and cut it short before we get in too much trouble.

Finally we talk about the Apple event this week and the new M1 chip.

Thanks for listening, please share with a friend.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
