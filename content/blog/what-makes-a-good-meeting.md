Dear Listener,

Last week, Jon had an idea for a discussion topic - What makes a good meeting. So that's what we spend the majority of this episode talking about.

Stan is also headed on vacation this week, he gives a little preview of what he'll be up to.

Stan lays out 3 types of meetings.

1. Trying to Find Something Out (Receive Information)
2. Trying to Explain Something (Share information)
3. Trying to Collaborate.

Listen in as we take a not very organized approach to talking about meetings, what meetings should have, and some things that throw them off course.

That leads into a brief discussion on actual productivity vs. productivity theatre. In general we conclude that "productivity theatre" tries to address a symptom rather than the core problem.

Thanks for listening!
