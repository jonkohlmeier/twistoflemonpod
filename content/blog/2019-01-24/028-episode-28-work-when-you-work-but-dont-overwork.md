Dear Listener,

Today's episode kicks off with some follow-up by Stan on what he found to track his time when on his laptop. It seems promising so far.

The rest of the episode was sparked by a tweak about advice to new software Developers. Stan replied: "Time management. Work when you work, but don’t over work. When I was new I kept absurdly long days, sometimes worked on the weekend and was always connected by email. I’m a better engineer now that I manage time boundaries for myself."

This leads into what exactly he means and concrete takeaways from what we've learned through our career paths and some mistakes we've made along the way.

This episode feels a little different than some of our other ones. Mostly because Jon was really interested in learning everything he can from Stan.

Listen in, let us know what you think!

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
