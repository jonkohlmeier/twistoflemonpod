Dear Listener,

Stan had a rough week. He returned all of his shoes, his trusty robovac broke and he had a rough customer support experience.

Mastering Minimalism this week we talk about clearing out your storage spaces.

Life Tip is to give yourself an extra day after travel.

Finally we talk about Star Trek Picard and our initial thoughts and reviews. We will be spoiling the episode, even if we think you have no excuse at this point.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
