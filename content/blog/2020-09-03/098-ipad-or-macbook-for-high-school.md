Dear Listener,

This week we talk about football surprisingly. As well as Stan gives Jon some flack for forgetting to edit last weeks episode.

A brief update on Jon's house condition and the argument for personal business cards cover happen before we discuss Labor Day plans. Stan will be spending Labor Day on his beautiful new deck complete with fire pit.

Finally we give advice to Stan's nephew on whether he should buy and iPad or a MacBook.

Listen in and enjoy this whirl-wind episode.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
