Dear Listener,

Good news - No bad reviews on Reddit yet!

Why did we skip trick or treating to go to a church service? We talk through some reasons in this episode. The big reason ends up being the hymns. (You might even catch Jon singing.) Bottom line is good hymns trump candy.

In light of next week's elections, Jon asks Stan how he reasons out who to vote for.

After that downer - Jon has a milkshake review from Freddy's Frozen Custard.

Apple announced new hardware for the iPad Pro, Mac mini, and MacBook Air. Did Stan order anything? Why or why not?

Listen in, rate us (5 stars) on iTunes, post any complaints on Reddit and we'll talk to you next week!

\-Jon Kohlmeier
