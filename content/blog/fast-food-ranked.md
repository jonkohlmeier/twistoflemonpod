Dear Listener,

We check in on how Stan's RV trip went as his first post-pandemic vacation. Sounds like it went well for the most part.

Finally we kick off the discussion on our top Fast Food joints. Danchez submitted his top 5. Stan and Jon both go through their top 10. We'll be covering this more later, so if you agree or disagree let us know!

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier

P.S. If you'd like to hear about Loki, stick around for the post credits segment.
