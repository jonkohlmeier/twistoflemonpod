Dear listener,

Stan is liking Jon's new look - shaped beard, new glasses and all. Jon tells about his experience getting new glasses from Warby Parker.

The rest of the episode is spent discussion Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. This episode includes many many many spoilers. So stop the episode if you don't want anything to be spoiled.

Tune in next week to hear about our resolutions for 2020.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
