Dear Listener,

Stan has been on a purging spree. He's thinking about reading the Marie Kondo book and taking this to a whole new level.

That's actually the main topic of this episode, but somehow we touch on modern art, Andy Warhol, white space in design.

Ultimately this is a long talk about minimalism and cutting waste.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
