Dear Listener,

We're back to our normal studios with the normal people. We kick off the episode with a throwback to the Grilled Cheese Episode and how it's still causing controversy. This also leads into discussion on mayo and burger toppings.

In a previous episode Jon mentioned that Stan is his only friend and lamented how he lives in Indianapolis. Turns out that's not true. Jon has friends in Iowa one of whom left a review of the podcast on iTunes.

Because we've been on a Marvel kick we briefly touch on the new Spider-Man: Far from Home trailer. We're excited for the movie, but not as excited as we were for Endgame.

Thanks for listening. If you leave a review we'll read it on air. And send stickers!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
