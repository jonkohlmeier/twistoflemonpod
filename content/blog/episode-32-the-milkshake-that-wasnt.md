Dear Listener,

Stan had 2 milkshakes this week. Bringing our total milkshake reviews up to 3 in 2019. Listen in to hear what he thought about Potbelly's and Oberweis's takes on milkshakes. We also found what could be a milkshake abomination, but we haven't tried it yet. (Sorry Crusade Burger).

If you were stranded on a desert island and you could only take one country music album, what would it be? Jon and Stan weigh in. We want to hear what your album would be. Leave a comment on Facebook!

Jon got his snow blower and was ready to go for the impending snow storm.

Finally we talk about Amazon HQ2 bailing on New York. Stan and Jon weigh in.

We touch on resumes a little bit to keep our promise form last episode.

Grab a milkshake and listen in!

Thanks,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
