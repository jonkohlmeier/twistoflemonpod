Dear Listener,

We want to know where and when you listen to the podcast. This continues to surprise us.

Stan is going all in on Christmas decorating both indoors and outdoor. He's usually a little crazy with the Christmas music.

We've also started playing Xbox games together which is far more fun for Jon than waiting for Steelers games.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
