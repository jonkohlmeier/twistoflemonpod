Dear Listener,

We're only $100 dollars away from reaching our goal in support of Pastor Fritsche.

Next up, Stan and Jon talk about New Years Resolutions. Neither are resolution purists but set certain goals and try to cultivate habits.

This week we also find out that Stan and Jon have significantly different ideas around what should appear on an iPhone home screen.

That leads into a discussion on note taking apps and task list apps.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
