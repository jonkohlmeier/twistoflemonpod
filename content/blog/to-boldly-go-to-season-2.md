Dear Listener,

Welcome to season 2 with a twist of Lemon. Stan starts off with a new season resolution to find Jon a new router. Will this be the year that burger reviews take the place of milkshake reviews?

Stan has been having an existential crisis of whether we continue the podcast or not.

We have a new review! Thanks Angie for the review on iTunes.

Jon has a dream where his wife, Anna and Stan's wife Sara become the best of friends. He nudged it a little bit this week but pushing for a phone call.

To round out the episode Stan and Jon talk about the upcoming Star Trek series Picard.

Finally, Endgame is out! Stan has been working his way through the rewatch.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
