Dear Listener,

We're going to have to adjust next week's recording schedule so that Stan (and hopefully Jon) can get some good gaming in.

Mandalorian Season 2 is now airing. Get Stan's reaction to the first episode of season 2 and Jon's reaction to everything.

Update on Jon's house including the impromptu garage door repair.

We also cover Mint premium, what we can of the election and more!

Thanks for listening!

\- Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
