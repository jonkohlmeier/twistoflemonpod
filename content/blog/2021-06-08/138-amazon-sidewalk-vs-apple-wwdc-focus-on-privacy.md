Dear Listener,

On Monday Apple kicked off it's WWDC event with the opening keynote and State of the Union address. This was full of announcements on new technologies being brought to the operating systems in the Apple ecosystem.

Amazon has also done a silent release of their own utilizing some of the Echo products and Ring Products that is somewhat concerning.

Be sure to listen in to how some budget cleanup and Amazon sidewalk led to some surprises that Jon had for Stan.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
