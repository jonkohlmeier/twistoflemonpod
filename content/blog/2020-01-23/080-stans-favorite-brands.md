Dear Listener,

Today Jon is recording from the St. Louis area, we try to find out if there is a specific St. Louis cuisine and get an update on Stan's shoe decision.

Stan also tells us about his robocalls vacuum and per request from one of our favorite listeners (Mrs. Lemon), we talk about Stan's odd brand loyalty.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
