Dear Listener,

This week we start off with yet another correction, this time Jon messed up.

We have a couple of new reviews first a listener reviewed us on iTunes, then Jon reviews a milkshake.

We talk about the jam-packed WWDC keynote and highlights from the announcements. Listen in to get our take an all things Apple.

Finally we get around to talking about where we do our best work. Not necessarily location based, but what has to be true to do the best work.

Thanks for listening! Leave a review!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
