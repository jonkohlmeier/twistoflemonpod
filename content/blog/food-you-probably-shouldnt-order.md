Dear Listener,

This week we talk about Jon's birthday dinner last week including a milkshake review and kicks off our topic of regional foods you should probably only order in that region.

We also have an update on Jon's home repairs and talk about Lucy Lemon's newest Apple gadget.

Thanks for listening, Let us know if you home town has any really delicious cuisine that we shouldn't order anywhere else.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
