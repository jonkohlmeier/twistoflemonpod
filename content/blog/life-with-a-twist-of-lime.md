Dear Listener,

This week we experiment with our first episode including advertisers. Listen in to hear about some of the products that we know and love like LemonCoin, The Milkshake Madness Diet Plan, Kohlmeier's CONcoctions, Hole in One Roofing and Android Care Plus.

Plus get updates on Jon's roof, the state of email, and more!

Thanks for listening, please share with a friend and support our generous sponsors.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
