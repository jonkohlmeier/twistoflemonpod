Dear Listener,

Our about page hasn't been updated since we built the site originally, so we bring up some of the things that have changed since our initial bios. One day we might even get to updating the about page itself.

We also briefly touch on resolutions as we try to come up with topics to talk about for the last 2 episodes of the year.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
