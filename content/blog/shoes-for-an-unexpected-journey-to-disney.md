Dear Listener,

Stan did not pay any attention to the Jeopardy! Greatest of all Time tournament, but Jon was very excited about it.

We follow up on the ad blocker discussion from last week.

The conversation degrades a bit as Stan complains about his shoe buying process.

From Jon's point of view the conversation gets much better when Stan tells him that he recently finished The Hobbit - even if he didn't like it that much. (Make sure you listen to the bonus round today!)

Thanks for Listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
