Dear Financially Minded Listener,

Thanks for tuning in for Episode 8! This week Jon met his mortgage savings goal so he seeks advice from the most experienced guy he knows - Stan Lemon (who has gone through the process 6 times.) Stan drops some knowledge and points out some mistakes he's made in the past. Listen in and you just might learn something!

The cohosts both failed to complete our Milkshake homework so the milkshake followup will have to wait for another episode.

Pay no attention to the lawnmower background noise. We're still amateurs who don't have nice sound proof studios. (Sorry Gillespie.)

We'll be back next week,

Sincerely,

Jon Kohlmeier & Stan Lemon
