Dear Listener,

Happy Thanksgiving! On this episode we discuss our favorite Thanksgiving menu items and plans for this year. Stan tries to convince Jon that it's a good idea to spend a day at Epcot and we answer a question from regular listener Jeff (aka Sidd Finch) on how we produce the podcast.

Thanks for listening and we hope you enjoy this on your post dinner walk or while you're braving Black Friday crowds!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
