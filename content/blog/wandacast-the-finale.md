Dear Listener,

This week we are joined by regular guest Patrick "Marvel Expert" Sturdivant. We take a look at the final episode of WandaVision and step back and talk about the season as a whole.

Where do we go from here and what should we expect from Falcon and the Winter Soilder.

\*Non-Marvel fans, don't worry. This will be our last completely Marvel related episode for a while. Next week we'll be back with another guest, so stay tuned!

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
