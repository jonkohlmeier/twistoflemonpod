Dear Listener,

This week we recorded early because Stan was going on a vacation to nowhere to do nothing. But at least he's taking some time off. Hopefully someone camped with him.

We follow up on Jon's first meat smoking adventure. Listen in to hear how the chicken turned out.

Finally Jon has been watching Gotham recently listen in to his reactions of Season 1 and the first several episodes of Season 2.

If you like what you hear please share with a friend and review us on your favorite podcasting app.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
