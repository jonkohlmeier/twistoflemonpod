Dear Listener,

This week Stan gives us an update on his shoe adventure. And get his initial reaction on Air Pod Pros.

Aaron Fenker is picking up his meat rub pretense. Be sure to check out [The BBQ Rev on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCggewclHIXhklyHezTmF6Sw).

Stan goes political without Jon's blessing in a super secret topic on the agenda.

Finally we talk about the Apple Event coming up next week and what our hopes and dreams are for it.

If you like what you hear, share with a friend.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
