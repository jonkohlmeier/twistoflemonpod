Dear Listener,

Winter is not over yet. Jon spent nearly 2 hours shoveling after the most recent snow storm. Stan asks Jon about snow removal tools and discovers that he finally ordered a snowblower! Somewhere in there we go off on a tangent on Star Trek.

All weekend Stan was tweeting about the Alliance. Jon learns that this isn't a World of Warcraft or Firefly reference.. but just more football. Needless to say, Stan is really excited about it.

We talk about twitter and whether it's a good platform to have a conversation/interview. #KaraJack.

Leave a review on iTunes. We'll read it on air and if you send Stan your address we'll send a sticker!

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
