Dear Listener,

Thanks for tuning in again week!

In Episode 6 of Life with a Twist of Lemon, Stan tells us about his trip to Atlanta for work. He has Jon salivating over some of the food he found and looking up plane tickets to head to Atlanta.

All of that somehow leads into Jon's new Amazon Echo, the greatest trivia device ever... but at what cost? From there they go down the trail of home automation, current smart devices and future plans. (Stan will probably keep just using Alexa as a fancy timer.)

Let us know what else we should use our home assistants for on social media.

Sincerely,

LWaToL Hosts

_P.S. Sorry for setting off your Alexa devices multiple times this episode._
