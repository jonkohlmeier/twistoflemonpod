Dear Listener,

Stan ran into some interesting people in Indianapolis, at Wylipalooza of all places. But he didn't get a milkshake.

Stan is disappointed that we reached Episode 52 but we haven't been doing this for a year quite yet. We'll have a full on celebration here in a couple of weeks.

Stan did pay off his mortgage in the last week, we're curious what he's going to do next.

Apple has been in the news a couple of times recently, most notable for the departure of Jony Ive. We reflect on what he's done for Apple and wonder what will happen moving forward.

Another core tennant of the podcast is Marvel. So we talk about going to see Spider-Man far from Home and other things Marvel.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
