Dear Listener,

This week we talk about all things Technology, from the ongoing gaming console adventures, to the new macOS, to super fast apple silicon numbers.

Listen in, and if you have a Nintendo Switch you should play Mario Kart with us.

You can check out Stan's blog posts at https://stanlemon.com.

Thanks for Listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
