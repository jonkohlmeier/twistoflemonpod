Dear Listener,

Jon is back from Nashville, which prompted some follow up on roundabouts. Turns out they have a great patent idea too. Jon also talks about the food he found in Nashville which included our first review in a while!

Mastering Minimalism: Capsule Wardrobe

We also give our initial thoughts on Disney+ including talks about Boy Meets World and the Mandalorian.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
