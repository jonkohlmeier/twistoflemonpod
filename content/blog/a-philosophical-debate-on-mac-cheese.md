Dear Listener,

Stan is experimenting with Catalina again, he's running it on a separate partition. Not ready to commit to a full update yet.

Stan is also looking for snow new snow boots. He has an ad hoc Life Tip, boots are important for dry feet in the snow. As with most things Stan has very strong opinions on snow boots.

Mastering Minimalism: Don't buy single-use kitchen appliances. If you want to be minimalistic, take a look at the kitchen items that you use each week. And get rid of everything else that you don't use on a regular basis.

Against Jon's better judgment, They talk about when add-ons make Mac and cheese a casserole. Much like the Grilled Cheese conversation, the criteria are all based on if anything overpowers the named ingredient.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
