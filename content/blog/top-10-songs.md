Dear Listener,

Merry Christmas! This week we talk about Christmas plans and cover a listener submitted topic: Our Top 10 Songs (Subjectively, like you'd listen to these 10 songs before you die or something like that.)

It turns into more of a 10 songs we like, plus some others. Hope you enjoy!

Thanks for listening!
