Dear Listener,

This week we're getting back to normal by talking about pretty much whatever comes to our minds. We reflect on the events of last week, both on the podcast and in the US.

Stan gives us an update on where he is in Middle Earth.

Stan has been using [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) recently and completely recommends it for all internet users.

[TheBBQRev](https://thebbqrev.com) came through big time for Christmas; Jon and Stan each received smoked salt and two meat rubs for Christmas, stay tuned as we continue to try them out.

Finally we take a look at a list of Pixar movies ranked thanks to listener, Katie. Neither Stan nor Jon agree with the list. Stay tuned for their lists in the coming weeks.

Thanks for listening please share with a friend!

\- Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
