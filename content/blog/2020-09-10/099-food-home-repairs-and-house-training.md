Dear Listener,

Apparently we have a listener in a position of power at Iowa State, they cancelled plans to have fans at their first home football game. Stan gives us an update on his lagering process and we have an update on Fenker hamburger seasoning. We also have an update on Labor Day grilling.

This episode also includes regular updates on Jon's home repairs and another new house (pictured below).

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
