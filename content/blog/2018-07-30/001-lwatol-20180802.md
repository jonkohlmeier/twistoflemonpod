**SPEAKER_00:**
So, remind me again, what are we gonna call this thing? Life with a twist of lemon. 

**UNKNOWN:**
Drums, please! 

**SPEAKER_00:**
This is life. With a twist of lemon. I like that. Probably because it appeals to my vanity though. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, Kohlmeyer doesn't really make its way easily into a podcast name. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
It's too many syllables. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yep. And it's not a fruit. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, there's that. Did I tell you I got a neighbor with the last name Cherry? Really? Yeah, yeah. So my daughter's friends with a girl whose last name's Cherry. So lemon and cherry. It's just, it's kind of weird. Like you got a whole fruit basket forming. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Your street isn't some other fruit, is it? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
No, no, no, no, no. No, it's like Goose Rock or something. I don't know what they named my street after. It's probably random. You know, these subdivisions, but. Right. We've been talking about doing this for, I don't know, like two years, three years. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Probably at least. The thing is we always start, we start talking on the phone and we think, Hey, this would make a really good podcast. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I actually feel like that happened the other night and that like resurfaced this whole conversation because we had had a lull where nobody had said, Hey, we should make a podcast for awhile. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
It's kind of funny, you know, we've both spent quite a bit of time in the podcasting world. We've both had appearances on a podcast, but we've never had like our own podcast. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Never had our own podcast. And the other podcasts were very much structured and not just us shooting the breeze and being friends. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on now. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Are you calling higher things radio structured, really? Towards the end, towards the end, we lost all structure. There was a episode where you talked about the Pittsburgh Steelers for the entire hour, another episode where you were talking about Marvel movies for the entire hour. So really, maybe that was the beginning of this podcast. Just to be clear, those were good episodes. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
They might have been some of the better episodes. Yeah, there's some truth to that. Now, so rewind, right? Even before you were on co-hosting with Borghardt, you were doing the whole editing scene. I feel like as long as I've known you, you've been editing audio of some sort. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, when did that start? 2009? No, 2008. 2008, I started editing podcasts. That's crazy. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Now, hopefully this will not be as editing intensive as Higher Things Radio was because 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'm not spending six hours editing this. Sorry, Stan. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
It's just amazing to think six hours of Borghardt's voice streaming in your ear. So your background is in editing. Mine was actually in hosting. I worked for Liberated Syndication as a technical lead for, I don't know, like a year and a half or whatever, which is big stuff in the podcast world. Lipsyn hosts a bunch of podcasts. Back when I was there, we hosted a bunch of NPR podcasts. I think NPR probably doesn't use them anymore. I could be wrong. Who knows? I'm not in touch with any of that, but I know that was like a big deal. And then we hosted podcasts like WTF with Marc Maron, which love it, hate it, whatever. It's a big deal in the podcast world. I don't know that I've really spent time editing as probably evidenced by the fact that I couldn't get Audio Hijack Pro to work right tonight. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, that was an issue. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
But you know, we learn, we move on. Computers are hard, man. I mean, I feel like when I have issues like this, I call my IT guy up. I just can't do that for this particular one, right? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
The benefits of working in a big company. I am the IT guy and everything else. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
It's funny. Does your family, like your mom, your dad, everybody ask you for computer help still? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, my mom does all the time. What do you say? Do you offer to help? It depends on what the question is. So recently, she's trying to digitize all these slides from my grandma. They had slides from their wedding that she tried to get in digital formats. And now she's kind of going through and was trying to figure out the best way to organize them. So she had a bunch of questions around that, too, from everything. How do I get these in order in a file on my computer in the order that she wants? I said, you should probably look at a different option than just using Finder and renaming things. So check out Flickr or SmugMug or something like that. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
That's good. I mean, I don't know. You're a better man than me. Let me put it that way. Because when my mom calls me up and says, hey, I got a computer question, and she describes it. My mom is probably going to be the only person that listens to those podcasts, so I've got to be careful what I say. But mom will say, I can't find these photos I took or whatever. What should I do? And being the snarky son that I am, the first thing I say is usually, well, I would call my IT guy. Which, you know, it's kind of a jerky thing to do. But I feel like for a long time, I used to get questions about Windows computers and it was easier because it was like, you know, I don't do Windows. I haven't been on Windows since 2004, maybe 2003 probably. It's been a long time, right? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
That never worked for me because my formal training is all in Windows operating systems. Now I'm all Mac. I don't touch a Windows computer. So for anyone listening, now you know. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Well, yeah. I mean, I tried that though. It didn't necessarily work. That was the problem. Right. So I'd be like, you know, I'd say, I don't use windows. Well, could you take a look at it anyhow? Cause you, cause you dig in, cause you look a little closer and it was like, ah, I really don't want to, but you can't say that. Right. Because it's, it's like family or friends or the worst is people from church, you know, when they ask for help. I've not run into that. Oh, you're lucky. Very lucky. So, you know, I mentioned my mom will probably listen to this. Who else do you think will get to listen? Do you think there's any chance of Borkart tuning in? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
No, absolutely not. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
For those that have no idea who George Borkart is, which would be amazing if you're bothering to listen to us and you don't. But on that slim chance, he's a dear friend of both of ours that we knew through an organization called Hire Things, which is a nonprofit Lutheran youth organization that we both used to be involved in, and we both have retired from, but Borghardt, you know, lives on in that. He's also my son's godfather. And yeah, he's a good guy. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
He is a good guy with his own little quirks. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I just would it be amazing if we could get him to subscribe? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'm sure that if you sent him an invitation or something, nice heartfelt personal letter from Stan Lemon, I think he would subscribe. Would he ever listen to a whole episode? Who knows? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Maybe he'd make it this far. It's only 30 minutes. It's only 30 minutes. We're talking about four card here. I don't think there's a chance of my wife listening. Will your wife listen? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I believe she will. My wife probably will. My dad probably will. My older sister will probably tune in too. Elizabeth? Elizabeth. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, okay. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Not your younger sister? Probably not. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I don't think my sister will listen. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I don't know. Do you like the generation? I guess it's not really a generation, but like the age group right behind us, do they listen to podcasts? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't know, that's a good question, because I know podcasting's kind of had a resurgence, right? So there are tons of podcasts now, different podcast apps, there's streaming networks, Stitchers and the whole thing, Spotify's even in the game. I feel like it's a bigger deal than it was even five years ago, but I don't know. I don't know if that's, if the generation behind us listens to podcasts. I know that the generation, like the generation after us definitely does, but once you get into baby boomer territory, they have no, I mean, at least my experience with baby boomers is they mostly don't know what's going on. And if they do listen to podcasts, it's just shows that ran on the radio. I listen later, like that's, my dad does that, right? My dad listens to Wisconsin public radio stuff afterwards. At least I think he does. Could just be audio books for all I know. What podcast do you listen to regularly, John? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
So I've been pretty bad at listening to podcasts regularly, but my go-to's are The Way I Heard It, Mike Rowe's podcast, which is nice, 10 minutes, and really interesting. Like, I've never heard a bad episode of The Way I Heard It, The Art of Manliness podcast, when the topic catches my eye, and then 99PI I listen to. What other ones do I tune into regularly? That might be it. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
So I do listen to Mike Rowe. I generally like what he does. I think I listen to a lot of stuff when my kids are around and some of his stories as of late have been a little racy for my kids. But, you know, I mean, It's good stuff. It's good writing anyhow. I think the things that I listen to consistently are the indicator from Planet Money, which is economics, a little short 10-minute doohickey. I listen to Planet Money all the time. Again, economics, I just totally dig it. And then I do listen to 99PI. That one is quite regular. Let me think here. Oh, what Trump can teach us about con law. That's probably my favorite podcast right now. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Now you told me about this one. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. That's another Roman Mars one. And so he's got this neighbor that I think she teaches at Berkeley or SoCal. I don't know. One of the big California schools. But she teaches constitutional law. And they basically do constitutional law from Trump's tweets. And I find it fascinating. The history of it and all that is just really great. I feel like I have to mention three other podcasts that I think got me back into listening to podcasts or got me into listening to podcasts. Maybe I should say four. This is getting complicated real quick. So cereal from This American Life, I really enjoyed the first two seasons. I'm looking forward to season three. I didn't get into S-Town, like I listened to it, but I didn't get into it as much, which that's a whole different like take on podcasting, right? I listened to Presidential, which I think I told you about. It started a year before the election where we got Trump. Each episode came out each week, and it was about every president that we've had in the country. And being kind of a history buff and a biography buff, that one I just soaked up. There's one related to it called Constitutional, same host that was pretty good too. Not as good, but it was pretty good. And then, you'll appreciate this, right? Control-Walt-Delete. Yeah, Otto mentioned that. Yeah, yeah. That one ending broke my heart because it was unequivocally my favorite tech podcast. Walt Mossberg is a classy dude. I think he's got just great analysis and critiques. And I feel like most Mac or Apple aficionado podcasting is so painfully negative that Walt was like a breath of reasonable, rational fresh air. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, he's very logical in how he approaches everything. Now, we might not always agree on everything, but I could always appreciate how he got to his point of view, and I understood why. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I will say this, too. I think so one of the things that I I've been thinking a lot about and we'll we really I think we could probably talk about the new MacBooks for a whole 30 minutes. That's actually it's not the conversation that started. Hey, should we do a podcast again? Probably because we're both looking at the new MacBook Pros. Let's let's let's say that for the next episode that actual discussion. But I've been reading blogs and stuff talking about how the MacBook Pro is a more expensive computer for less hardware. And the way they talk about it, people will say this and then they'll say, but I love Mac OS so much. And I was thinking about this the other day. I think people have gotten used to the notion that Mac OS is free. And so they look at the hardware and they think, yeah, the processor might be a little slower than whatever Dell, you know, the memory is not DDR4 in the 13 inch or whatever, like stuff like that. And they compare it to Dell or to IBM. You're not IBM, whatever it's called now, ThinkPad. Lenovo. Yeah, that's that's right. Right. Lenovo. Anyhow. So they look at that and then they forget that you are not just buying a computer. You're buying the operating system and you are buying that streamlined everything works experience. And I think we've forgotten about it because we don't actually buy OS upgrades anymore. Right. Right. But but you think about it. Yeah, maybe the $2,000 computer you bought is actually $1,500. And if you harken back to when I got into OS X, every year I dropped $100 on the next, or maybe it was every two years, I don't know, but $100 on the next version of OS X. And you add that up, and suddenly the gap doesn't look so big to me. I don't know. That's kind of the way I look at it. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
The other thing here is I'm currently recording this on a MacBook Pro mid 2012 edition. So this is over six years old now. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, longevity is a big deal. Gosh, should I show my colors here? I have a 2011 Mac Mini server that is my only personal computer at the moment, which is ancient. I had the original 15-inch MacBook Pro up until, I don't know, a year and a half, two years ago. I guess it was maybe a year and a half ago. Anyhow, I sold that because I was getting ready to buy the next mobile. And then I got cold feet, dragged them a bit, and decided not to. I'm going to finally pull the trigger though, soon. But again, that's next episode. Right. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
But yeah, longevity is a big deal, right? Right, absolutely. And like, I could probably use this for another two years. I have a fan that needs to be replaced, but other than that. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
At least on that edition, you can replace it, right? Correct. Oh, now I sound like this negative Mac podcast. But so we got onto that topic because we were talking about Control-Walt-Delete, which was a great podcast. Neelai was also on there with Walt Mossberg, Neelai Patel from The Verge. Neelai, I think, is a solid critic. He's a little more harsh on the Apple ecosystem. But I felt like Walt needed that. And again, it was just an hour long podcast once a week with just good, solid tech analysis. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
And now that we got you all excited about it, you'll have to go back and listen to episodes from over a year ago. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Well, you know, he did have that, um, what is this in May? Didn't he pop back on? Oh yeah, they did. Yeah. Special edition for the IMAX. So that's, I still, I still say stay subscribed to it just in case they drop another episode. Right. I've tried listening to other podcasts from The Verge. I think, I mean, they're longer. The language is a little much for my kids. And then they're always talking all over each other too. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
So kind of like we do, except I don't talk that much, so you might be safe. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
But hey, I shut up long enough there for you to say what you're gonna say. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right. I think another podcast that is on my list I listen to occasionally is How I Built This with Guy Raz, NPR podcast. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Oh, that's a good one. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
So that's just interesting to hear the backstory of different companies and how they got started. So there was one with the guy who did Atari and Chuck E. Cheese, and that was fun. I haven't listened to anything recently. I could probably look and see what they've talked about recently. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I mean, so I listened to the one on Lyft, I don't know, a month or so ago, and that was pretty solid. I really liked that episode. I mean, there were other decent ones like Honest Tea was pretty good. I'm trying to think what the other one that really stood out to me. Oh, Bob's Red Mill was fun because I like the bake. You know, I kind of could relate to that one. And then there was another one here. Oh, Wayfair was good. Fubu was good. Larabar was good. I'm scrolling through looking at the list. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
So you've listened more recently than I have, it appears. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I mean, this is one of my regular ones. Oh, the James Dyson one was fantastic because he's uber nerdy. Michael Dell was also good. But yeah, I think more often than not, I mean, Guy Raz does the whole podcasting thing. I think really solid. My kids listen to a podcast he does as well. And then, you know, the Ted Radio Hour, I don't listen to it regularly, but that is that is a pretty good podcast as well. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
So, now we've told them everything I can listen to besides us. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
But you really should tell your friends to listen to John and I. I don't know, what do listeners mean to us? Because we're not doing advertising, we're not going to try and make money. I guess it's for our vanity. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Our vanity, now we can go back and remember what we talked about. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, that's true. That's true. Little archive of it. Do you think listeners will make me any more arrogant than I already am? Probably. Interesting. All right, well, we'll have to keep a barometer on that. Maybe we'll have a scorecard. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
There you go. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Lemon's arrogance. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
If we hit 100 subscribers. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Are we, we got to figure out a tree. See, here's the thing. All right. Now you're scratching an itch for me because how are we going to track those John? This is the software engineer me thinking, are we going to, are we going to use something out there? Are we going to build something? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Are we going to, do you want to build something, Stan? I don't have time for that, but you could probably whip something up in half an hour. Do you want to build a tracker? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't know. I mean, maybe. Probably not at the gate. But we should figure that out, John. We should figure out a place to put this stuff. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
An excuse to build more software. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
It actually, I mean, it is kind of interesting, right? Like I think the podcast hosting and tracking, if you will, realm is a little fuzzy because like there's stuff you can shoehorn into WordPress. Okay, got it. There are things like, you know, FeedBurner will do its thing. You got PodTrack. There's tools, but none of them are real pretty at the end of the day. Lipsyn wasn't bad, I will say that, like the analytics, the stats stuff was pretty solid. It's probably also some of the more complicated engineering I've ever worked on, oddly enough. Interesting. Long time ago, it feels like forever. I was living in Pittsburgh and that was, let me think now, three, four jobs ago? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Can we just run through how long, what's the longest you've ever kept a job? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
That's this job, man. Well, I shouldn't say, hold on, let me think about this. Cause like does higher things count? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Sure. Why not? You worked for them for full time for a while. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Okay. So you want to just count the full time? Cause that's probably still HT. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
So that was what? 10 years? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Full time? No, not full time. But yeah, let me think. So that would have been full time. I think technically started in 07 and It might've even been 08, but I think it was 07. And it went till, how old's my son? Henry is, so like, I guess it was only only five years at most with HD. So I'm about to eclipse that full time. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
And what's the shortest job you ever had? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Uh, I think that was eight and a half months. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Eight and a half months. You made it that long. Why did I think that you had something that was like six and a half? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
No, I mean, I'd have to go back and look. So there were two jobs in there, preceding the one I have now, that were pretty quick. They were both not the most healthy work experiences I've had. That's me trying to say it constructively. And I, for the sake of my sanity and my family, had to make changes pretty quick. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right. We should note that you've never been fired from a job. It's always you making the move. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
So it's not like you're a bad worker. You got fired? Back in college. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
That's not full time though. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. That's true. I've never been fired from a full time job. I did get fired from my college web services job. They hired me back the following year, but they did, they did terminate me. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I feel like there's a story there. I don't know if you have time for it or not. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
There is definitely a story there. It's funny we're talking about this because I was, do you ever, like you got your folder in Dropbox or OneDrive or something. Right, yeah. And it's like a whole bunch of crap is just floating around in there. And I scanned my termination letter at some point and put it in this folder. So I'm like, I'm just, you know, sitting on the couch with my iPad, browsing through files and there it is. And I look at it, and I was like, wow, it feels like forever ago. And you get to thinking about how stupid the whole situation is. And then I'm like, why did I save this PDF, right? And I think it's so that I don't forget both my immaturity and then also the ridiculousness of liberal arts institutions. Because that's really what it's a memorial to. I should probably, I don't think I still have the original copy, but I should get it framed. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Borchardt probably told you to keep it. Because once I was dating this girl back in the day and her parents really did not like me. So her dad had sent me this email about how I wasn't going anywhere and stuff like that. So Borchardt told me to keep that letter and have it sit on my desk as motivation. And then when I was making a million dollars to send him a copy of my pay stub and just let it... So you probably got it from Borchardt. He's told me a similar thing. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
I could, I could see that. Yeah. It's kind of his kind of his MO, right? Like hold onto it for that moment. Um, I don't know. Here's the thing though. I don't know that I actually knew him when this went down. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh yeah. Yeah. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think this was pre Borkhart. This was, this was, uh, my freshman year at college. And, um, you know, I had a blog. You remember blogs. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I remember blogs. That's how we met, man. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Insider Homie LC. Oh, boy. Good grief. You know how that came to be? So that was my domain. I do not own this domain today. It is insider with a Y, homielc.com. And the LC was loves Christ. And the Insiders were a contemporary Christian ska band. They were my favorite. And I think Never did it dawn on me that I should buy like stanlemon.com or lemon.com. And this is back when domains were expensive too. And so I was like, oh, I'll come up with something cool. And that was it. That's what I came up with. And I remember I had like graffiti style lettering on the banner on the first version of the site way back in the day. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That was a long time ago. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Oh yeah. It was a very long time ago. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I first started bugging you in 2005. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
We're old, John. We're old. I was 13 years ago. Where were you? Were you in high school? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh yeah. I was a sophomore in high school. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I was, I was in college. I was at Concordia University. River forest. Got to be confused with Chicago. They sit on the same corner, but. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Look relatively the same different moves. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Actually, supposedly they don't look the same. I haven't been back to see, um, all the like remodeling they've done, but they've moved some stuff around. So nice. I was a single guy living on campus, living the dream, studying Greek and Hebrew and getting fired from web services or whatever it was. Yeah, we'll save that story for another time. That's a gem that we can, you have to get me all worked up about Lutherism and the Missouri Synod, and then I can rant about my termination story. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know what's great about that, Stan? We're free to do that without getting anybody except ourselves in trouble. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
That is true. That is true. Yeah, we used to have to hold our tongue back in the day. Really, I don't know that you had to hold your tongue, because you're not really like... 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'm a nice guy. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, you're not the kind of guy that's gonna drop a bomb on Facebook and then, you know, diss some publishing company or something, you know, upset people. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Publishing companies? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Not that I would ever do that. No, never. You've prepared a lot, Stan. That's what you think, John. 

**UNKNOWN:**
That's what you think. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
So all right, we're going to do 30 minute stints, right? That's 30 minute episodes. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Sure. That sounds like a good length of time for people to deal with listening to us. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. And we're basically going to take the conversations that you and I usually have on the phone and do them in a podcast. Is that the gist? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
That is the deal, except I'll probably still call you on my way home from work and then we'll come up with things that we're talking about that we should make onto the podcast. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, I can get behind that. Out of curiosity, do you think that people still talk on the phone? We do. I know we do, but like, here's the thing. I've looked at my cell phone bill. You are the only person I call. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I call you and my mother, I guess. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, well, I don't even do that well. So there are some months when I get back and John Kohlmeyer's name is the only number on my cell phone bill. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
How does Sarah feel about this? 

**SPEAKER_00:**
I should ask her. See, here's the thing, though. I work from home. So in my defense, she's always over there. You know, like I could just say, hey, Sarah, we're good to go. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, wow. I'm gonna have to get some other people to start calling you, Stan, otherwise this is gonna get weird real fast. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Borghardt used to call me. So if he does happen to listen, this is a reminder, Pastor Borghardt, that I haven't heard from you in a long time, and I would like to talk to you. We used to talk all the time, so give me a call. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Ah, good luck with that one. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
So all right, we're gonna take our conversations, we're gonna put them in a podcast format, whatever that means. And we're gonna try and do this, what, once a week? Once a week. Have you picked a day yet? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
I have not. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, you'll have to figure that out. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Tuesdays or Thursdays are usually good days, right? To release or to record? To release. We can record whenever. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
We're that free. Yeah, that's true. I mean, I'm going to leave the release semantics up to you. If you need a sugar daddy to swipe a credit card for something, you let me know. But otherwise, I'm going to probably lay low on the release bit. But we're going to take our conversations. We're going to do it once a week for roughly 30 minutes. I say roughly because we're about to cross the 30-minute mark, and I don't really care. um and it's just gonna be casual we're probably gonna what we're gonna talk about computers because computers yeah probably mostly apple stuff we're gonna definitely talk about that they talk about finance a lot oh yeah yeah we do talk about finance um which we'll have to do a whole episode just on you buying a house at least an episode yeah So I imagine we will talk about Lutheran stuff, right? A little bit of theology. Probably. Yeah. So that's faux pas number one. We will talk religion. Unfortunately. Faux pas number two. Are we going to talk about politics? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Uh, probably I could talk about politics with you because we both hate everyone. So there's that. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Here's the thing though. If we, if we go down the politics road, um, the number of listeners we have might divide in half, but like basically I think my mom might stick it out. I just don't know who we'll recover from us talking politics. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, maybe we'll try it once and see what happens. If we get hate mail, they'll have to find us on Twitter or something, because we have no email address. I guess we have to host these somewhere, so maybe I can put a contact form up. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Nah, don't do that. Let's leave it at Twitter, where the internet thrives. Or can we start a Reddit for our podcast? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Maybe. Do you ever go on Reddit? I don't, really, unless it pops up in search results for something. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't either, so that might be the perfect place to have conversations. 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Life with a twist of love and subreddit. 

**SPEAKER_00:**
Now we're talking. All right, and I guess, how are we gonna end it? Like, is there, are we just gonna stop talking? 

**SPEAKER_01:**
Sure. Well, that's all for today. We'll see you next week. Here's hoping.
