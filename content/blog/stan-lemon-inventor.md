Dear Listener,

This week Stan's patents have been approved! We talk about what he actually invented and some of the process.

We also revisit not posting episodes on Facebook, Jon's new toy - a pressure washer and baseball being back.

Thanks for listening! If you like what you hear please share and give us a review!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
