Dear Listener,

Stan is very upset and very opinionated on Grilled Cheese. So we spend some time following up.

Next up we have two new iTunes reviews bringing us to a total of 11! Thanks friends.

Jon learned some valuable lessons on digital marketing by boosting their first post on Facebook. Listen in to hear about lessons learned.

We've started a Milkshake movement.. so milkshake reviews probably aren't over with just yet.

Somehow that leads in to Pokemon.. card game, PokemonGo, animated series and more.

We almost make it through the episode without mentioning the new Avengers trailer! Jon catches it and we talk through the trailer before signing off for this week.

Listen at your own risk. Leave a review.

Thanks!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
