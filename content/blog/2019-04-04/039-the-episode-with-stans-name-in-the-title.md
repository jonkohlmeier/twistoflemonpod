Dear Listener,

Today Stan kicks off the episode with another correction from last week's episode.

The Apple live event has come and gone listen in to hear Stan and Jon's take. We talk Apple News, Apple Pay, Apple Arcade, Apple Channels, and Apple TV+.

This week Patrick had good Marvel Intel! We have Avengers Endgame tickets. The story of acquiring the tickets is worth listening to in itself.

Thanks for listening and leaving reviews!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
