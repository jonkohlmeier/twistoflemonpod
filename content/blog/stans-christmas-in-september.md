Dear Listener,

Today we celebrate Stan's Christmas in September. But first we get an update on Little League and what it has done for the Lemon household's dinner.

Stan got some new toys even before Christmas in September most notably a NAS, you can listen in to hear more about that.

Finally we get to the news of the day, Stan's Christmas in September, the apple event. We cover Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, iPads, Watch Series 5, iPhones and more. Get our take on the Apple announcements and listen in to hear if we'll be making any purchases.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
