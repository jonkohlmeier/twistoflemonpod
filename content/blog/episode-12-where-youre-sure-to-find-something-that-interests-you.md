Dear Listener,

I'm not even really sure where to start for this episode. We cover a plethora of topics from tech to food, to reading non-fiction. You're sure to find something that interests you in this episode (even if it only is the soothing sound of The Lemon's voice) Maybe it will be easier if I just list some of the topics out.

- New recording settings
- Milkshakes (of course)
- Apple Activity
- Meat, Rubbed and Salutary
- Recipes
- Killer iOS feature - Password manager.
- Screen time and tactics to use phone less.
- Reading Non-fiction books
- Apollo 8
- Art of Manliness episodes
- The Great Books

Enjoy the show!
