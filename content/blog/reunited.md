Dear Listener,

In this episode we review Jon's visit to Stan in Indianapolis. All core tenants of the podcast were observed: Meat, Milkshakes, Macs, and Mixology (And Marvel but we don't talk about that until the post-credit scene.). Listen in, it was a fun time together after not seeing each other in person for the first time in 19 months.

We also talk about some announcements including the trailer for the Many Saints of Newark and the new Nintendo Switch.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
