Dear Listener,

This we we discussed the new Disney+ MCU series WandaVision. They released the first two episodes last Friday and we provide our initial reactions.

For the nerd who is not interested in Marvel - we spend the second part of the episode discussing the recent changes to Finance mobile app Mint and talk about budgeting post-pandemic.

Thanks for listening (we're glad nothing terrible happened yesterday.)

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier.
