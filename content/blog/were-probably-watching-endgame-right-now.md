Dear Listener,

We have another review on iTunes! Then Stan yells at Jon for his terrible audio quality last week.

This is the week! Jon is currently in Indianapolis. We're excited for Endgame. It's finally here!

Stan is paying attention to baseball again. At least currently because the Pirates have the best record in the National league.

We talk through how we would rank the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Listen in and stay tuned to our Endgame Episode guest starring the one, the only, Patrick Sturdivant.
