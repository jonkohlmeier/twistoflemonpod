Dear Listener,

Are we getting closer to the fall of Facebook? Facebook was down for hours this week and they've been getting some really bad press recently.

This leads us into a discussion on the future of the podcast, the evolution of social media and basic right and wrong.

Finally Stan is having some more car issues that have him considering replacing the vehicle.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
