Dear Listener,

We started recording to try to get ahead before Stan's upcoming travels. Turns out the episode we recorded for next week was very time sensitive as we talk about Post-Season baseball.

Listen in to our take on this years October baseball. We also discuss the dismissal of our teams managers Clint Hurdle from the Pirates and Joe Madden from the Cubs.

Definitely a sportsball focused episode but we'll be back next week with our normal discussing topics all over the place.

Thanks for listening and we hope you'll leave a review.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
