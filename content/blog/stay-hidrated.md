Dear Listener,

Jon is recording from Louisville and will be visiting Stan on the way back. We do some research into what constitutes "Kentucky food" and settle on bourbon.

Stan has been getting tweets from LG about his LG Ultrafine review from a couple months ago. We'll have to wait and see if he'll turn into the next spokesperson.

Finally we review the [HidrateSpark Steel](https://amzn.to/3hgZInc) water bottle. Both Stan and Jon got one recently and have mixed feeling about it.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
