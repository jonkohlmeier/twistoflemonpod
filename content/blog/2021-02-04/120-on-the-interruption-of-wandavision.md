Dear Listener,

We kick off the episode talking about WandaVision episode 4 "We Interrupt this Program." We speculate on everything that is going on and welcome back some MCU Alumni.

Stan finished his trek through reading The Lord of the Rings. Jon gets nerdy and Stan liked it more than he liked the Hobbit.

Finally we give an update on what we've been playing on Xbox.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
