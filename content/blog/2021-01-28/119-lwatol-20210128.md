**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:00]

Dramas, please.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:13]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:20]

This is life

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:22]

with a twist of lemon.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:24]

Okay, John. It is the twenty sixth. We have this recorded on Tuesday before we release on a Thursday.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:30]

Last Tuesday, there was a little bit of speculation that the world would come apart.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:36]

Just left over there. We left the possibility open.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:38]

Yeah. We did. But, I mean, how's it going over there?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:42]

All is good in the coalmire bunker. We got probably about six inches

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:46]

of snow,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:49]

but that's about it. Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:52]

Well,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:54]

I think everything's okay here too.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:56]

I did I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:58]

did scale back my

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:00]

news consumption a little bit Which I've been telling you to do for years.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:05]

What yeah. Yeah. Now

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:08]

tell me how you really feel, John.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:10]

But I I think the the thing is after the inauguration, I felt like I could

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:15]

take a breath, like a deep breath. I don't know if that's actually true, but that's how I felt. And so I I toned it back even more than I already had. There you go. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:24]

I am

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:26]

you don't like the news app, right, on iOS?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:29]

No. Not particularly.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:31]

But you have it installed right now. Right? I do. I think I it's actually improved

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:36]

here.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:38]

I'm recording on the right mic.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:41]

I think that it has actually improved here with the most recent OS update.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:48]

But, basically, I never just peruse the news app. Usually, I'm clicking a link that leads to the news app.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:54]

What was it that made you uninstall it in the first place?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:58]

I think it was the notifications.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:59]

So when I turned off the notifications,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:02]

then that was better.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:04]

I do have it in one of my smart stacks,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:08]

so I actually see, like, the top two headlines of the day in the evenings or whatever.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:14]

Wow. So I'm not completely oblivious anymore,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:16]

especially since I deleted Twitter.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:19]

Do you follow channels,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:21]

like, within the news app itself?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:23]

No. I have no idea how you would even do that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:26]

Are are you kidding me right now?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:29]

That's how how much time I've spent in the news app.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:33]

Okay. Well, so that means you're totally curated by Apple. If you are ever in the app, John,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:38]

at the at the bottom right,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:41]

there's a button that says following,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:44]

and it'll show you channels and topics that you've apparently opted into.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:48]

Maybe I set that up initially, like, when the news app was

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:51]

installed,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:53]

like, when it was introduced.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:55]

Gosh. That seems so long ago. It does.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:58]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:59]

you know, I subscribed to a few papers

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:02]

or I did.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:05]

I've I used to be a Twitter junkie. I like to stay up on politics because I like US history,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:11]

but I needed a I needed a breather. I have consolidated

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:15]

the way in which I consume

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:17]

to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:20]

mostly a single email

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:23]

and a single daily podcast.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:26]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:27]

I don't know if if I'm doing better or not. I think I'm doing better, but That's still a lot.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:33]

So I

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:34]

get a weekly email from

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:37]

Robinhood,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:38]

which touches on current events and how they

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:42]

might affect investments.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:44]

But yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:47]

So right now, I get an Axios AMPM email

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:50]

that, is just like I I don't know if you ever looked at Axios, but they do this, like, bulleted style

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:57]

collection of facts. It's it's real succinct.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:00]

And I like that because I can just absorb a whole bunch of it. I think I forwarded you an Axios email before, haven't I?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:06]

It's been a while, but maybe. Yeah. I mean, maybe I didn't. You didn't look at it too. But then with the the news podcast, it's just, like, ten, twelve minutes. It's the NPR,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:16]

like, this morning or this day or whatever, the the debrief one. And I I just listen to it while I'm eating breakfast.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:21]

Yeah. So because I'm all alone in my office with a bowl of cereal or

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:25]

a bowl of yogurt or a pancake. A bowl of something.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:29]

There you go. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:31]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:32]

I I've got I've got ten, fifteen minutes while I'm eating to listen, so I I catch up. But again, it's like, it's so rapid fire that it's just like, here's what happened. Boom boom boom. There's not even an opportunity for color commentary, and I think I like that. So Nice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:45]

Anyhow,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:46]

I didn't mean to talk about how we consume news. I just wanted to call attention to the fact that the world didn't end even though we were concerned about it. So they have it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:56]

This out of curiosity, did you watch the inauguration?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:59]

I tuned in for the actual inauguration,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:03]

and then fizzled off during parades and stuff like that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:07]

Oh, so you actually saw the beginning of a parade? I did.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:11]

Oh, wow. You watched more of it than I did, John. Funny. I had it in a window.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:16]

Did you did you watch

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:19]

the previous inauguration at all?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:21]

I did. I watched the whole thing of that too. Really? Wow. I'm impressed. And the one before that?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:27]

I don't think so,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:29]

because that would have been Obama term two. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:31]

Yeah. I think I watched Obama term one. I think that was the last time I watched the inauguration, though. Yeah. So I just I mean, I I set the kids down. We all watched as a family.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:42]

See? It was it was interesting. I am a big fan of

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:47]

tradition and ceremony.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:49]

Like, that kind of stuff always intrigues me. So I used to watch, like, holy week from the Vatican,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:54]

and the inauguration kinda falls into that.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:57]

I always love

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:59]

watching snippets of the changing of the guard at the tomb of the unknown soldier,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:03]

and things like that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:05]

Have you ever been to the tomb of the unknown soldier in person I have. Seen seen that happen? Okay. It's it's really something. The I don't think on camera

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:13]

does justice to the, like, somber intensity

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:16]

Right. Of that moment.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:18]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:19]

well, alright. I gotta ask. Lady Gaga,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:22]

yay or nay? Like, did think of her performance? So her actual vocal performance

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:27]

was better than I would have expected it to be.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:30]

Oh, see, I I I had no expect I I didn't doubt that she would do a good job singing. I was just concerned about, like, what sort of craziness

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:38]

Right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:39]

Would she bring with her? And that was a wild dress, but all in all, I mean, it wasn't slab of she's ever worn. So It wasn't a slab of meat, so it was relatively clean, you know.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:50]

Yeah. So I thought she did it alright. I'm still not a huge fan of Lady Gaga.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:56]

JLo, I thought, when she performed,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:59]

like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:00]

she is a super solid vocalist.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:04]

And as somebody who

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:06]

doesn't really listen to pop music often,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:10]

I think that probably says something.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:14]

Yeah. I enjoyed her performance. I actually thought all of these were solid. What did you think I know you don't like the song Amazing Grace, but what do you think of Tim McGraw? Or not Tim McGraw. Oh my gosh.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:23]

Garth Brooks. I just did that. I'm so sorry, Garth.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:27]

Yeah. I mean, I'm a big fan of Garth Brooks.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:30]

I thought he did fine.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:32]

Amazing Grace.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:34]

Okay. You know, Christians do have other hymns than Amazing Grace. For those of you who are in charge of

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:40]

events or movies or anything like that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:44]

It was quite a quite a diverse lineup, though, when you think about it. I I was dwelling on the fact that JLo is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:51]

so much older than Lady Gaga. I mean,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:54]

she's not a young lady anymore. You couldn't tell by looking at her.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:59]

And then you contrast it with Garth Brooks who

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:02]

is country superstar, but he's also I mean, he took, like, a really long hiatus.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:07]

Yep. So I don't know. I I enjoy those things. Let's just see what kind of the choices are and how it all,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:13]

you know, flushes out. I I do believe

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:16]

the hit of the day was Bernie Sanders' mittens

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:20]

as evidenced by

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:21]

the myriad of memes. Yeah. It was interesting.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:25]

Because like, I didn't follow a lot, but I was paying attention that day.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:29]

But like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:30]

the inauguration

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:32]

was maybe the third story on the list, like, actual

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:36]

inauguration

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:37]

of Harris and Biden.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:40]

But first was Bernie and Mittens, which is still lasting here a week. Oh, yeah. And then That's got a lot a lot of longevity.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:49]

Secondly, was the 22 year old poet,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:53]

who everybody was talking about.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:56]

I am pretty sure that I saw her perform

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:00]

previously

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:02]

on Some Good News, which was a YouTube show done by the guy from The Office. I can't remember his name. The goofy one, who also was Jack Ryan on the Amazon Prime show.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:11]

Alright. And I'm

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:13]

pretty sure I saw her perform there. So she wasn't net new to me, but I enjoyed that. I mean, I'm

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:19]

I like I like poetry. I like reading poetry. So Sure.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:23]

Maybe maybe I'll perform poetry here on the podcast for you right now, John. Yeah? No. No.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:31]

Fun fact. In the week leading up to when I proposed to the now missus Kollmeyer,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:36]

I wrote a poem one day where I compared myself to a tortilla.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:43]

I can see the resemblance. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:48]

How much did how much did you have to drink when you did that?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:51]

I don't think I drink anything. So I did something every day leading up to it, and then, like, she still didn't guess that anything was coming,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:59]

so she was still surprised. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:02]

Oh, so you gave the poem

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:04]

comparing you to a tortilla to missus Kolmeier.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:07]

Yep. So I sent that to her,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:11]

like, three days before I proposed or something like that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:15]

Wow. Okay. Well

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:17]

I used be romantic, Stan. Is that what that is?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:22]

Alright. Well, on that note, let's talk about something else mildly romantic.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:27]

I I out of curiosity, did you get any feedback about our WandaVision analysis last last week?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:33]

Patrick Sertivant said that it was a great episode.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:37]

My father-in-law, Mark Buto,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:39]

made comments about how he would have cohosted this show better than me.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:44]

Okay. Now that was that was when he was watching Dark World or something else. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:49]

but he he listened.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:51]

A lot of folks I know have been they've watched WandaVision. They're now going back through other movies in the MCU. And I was I was thinking

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:01]

through what movies would I recommend

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:04]

you watch in the MCU if you are going to try and, like, catch up quickly.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:09]

I think the most obvious one is Ultron. Absolutely. But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:12]

I was trying to think like okay. So you watch Ultron. Where do you go from there? What do you what do you watch next?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:18]

And I'm curious what your number two choices. I've already I've got it in my mind, but but where where do you go?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:25]

So probably

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:27]

Infinity War. I I mean, are you watching this? Have you watched the movies before or not?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:33]

I mean, I I think

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:35]

because you have like Captain America Civil War.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:38]

Yeah. I and I I think that's where I would go next. Yeah. Because I think you get a little bit more of her control and her power and her relationship

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:46]

with Vision.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:47]

Right? There's like there's like a tease to the relationship that then we see in Infinity War.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:52]

I think

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:54]

I think you have to this is a suspicion, and this is what I've been telling a few people.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:00]

I think that you have to watch Doctor Strange

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:04]

to get some context coming into this, because I think he's gonna play

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:08]

a a pretty big role

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:11]

in the show. Now, we should do the spoiler alert thing first of all. Like, we're going into

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:15]

WandaVision episode three. If you have not seen it,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:19]

press pause. Go watch on Disney plus. Come back. If you don't care, that's fine. We'll just chug along, but but spoiler alert.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:25]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:26]

in the comics, Doctor Strange delivers the twins,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:30]

and I was so hoping I was so hoping

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:33]

that he might do that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:35]

But alas,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:37]

he didn't we did get the twins though. Were you expecting the twins?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:40]

I was,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:42]

but I think it was because of something you and Patrick alluded to. Oh, well, there you go. I I ruined it. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:48]

so

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:49]

Tommy and Billy, right, are the twins names? Right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:52]

Same names from the comics.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:54]

The the time element on this

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:57]

goes rapid fire.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:00]

We she starts,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:02]

like, just a baby bump, right, at the end of episode two, which is what she's got at the start of episode three

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:08]

by I don't know what, three quarter of the way through the episode, we've got two babies.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:14]

Right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:16]

You really enjoyed

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:17]

the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:18]

throwback element on episode one, less on episode two. What did you think of episode three?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:23]

So the throwback element itself is exceptionally well done.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:28]

Again,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:29]

seventies,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:30]

probably not where I would go outside of

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:33]

Marvel. So Well, they're progressing by decade. So Yeah. Personal preference,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:39]

like

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:40]

okay. You're gonna hate the eighties, John. Now the eighties are like more than the seventies.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:44]

Oh.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:45]

Well and and they did a little bit of of my my kids thought it was Brady Bunch esque intro.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:52]

It's probably close. I I don't

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:55]

I would love It's know not a copy of the Brady Bunch. No. I'd love to know from the creators like how much are actually trying to specific sitcoms or just like styles.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:05]

Because my general feel is that that was

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:07]

like, if you see people in cubes on a screen or even even just shapes of any sort, you immediately go to Brady Bunch. I don't know that that necessarily means this is based off the Brady Bunch, but whatever. Right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:22]

We had the kids.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:24]

I think we've got the manipulation of time.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:27]

And then there's Geraldine.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:29]

Yep. Who's a return character.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:34]

What did you think when it became clear that Geraldine

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:38]

had some cognizance of of her world?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:43]

I guess I didn't really think anything. So, like, this isn't a surprise. Earlier in the episode, we had,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:50]

like, a glitch in the matrix,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:53]

where the neighbor is chainsawing through a rock wall.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:58]

So when she was kind of

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:01]

she kinda knew I don't know. I kinda like I expected it, I guess.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:07]

The thing that I am struggling to wrap my brain around is does she know

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:12]

that she's in Wanda's verse? Right. Or is she in Wanda's verse and then has like a a moment of sobriety?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:20]

And if it's the latter, I wonder if that actually applies to the neighbors too. Because there's this moment where

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:25]

the neighbors are like trying to tell Vision

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:29]

about

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:30]

Geraldine specifically.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:32]

Right? And I think the what they come up with is, like, she doesn't have a home. She doesn't have a place. She's she doesn't go, you know, she goes Not married. No family. Yeah. And and so

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:41]

has are these real people that have been absorbed into the Wandiverse? Like, Wandiverse appears to be in an actual town.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:47]

So I actually think it's entirely plausible these are real people. Right? What is it called? Westview, I think is the name of the town Yeah. That we see.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:55]

And why is Geraldine

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:58]

able

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:00]

to, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:01]

break out of her Wanda infused character more than the others? I think it's probably because she's she's a sword agent.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:09]

Right? We don't know yet if sword is good or bad, but we know that there's an organization and they're using the sword logo. They're probably the sword from Marvel comics. Right? Right. She drops a big bomb though

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:21]

in her dialogue with Wanda

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:24]

that eventually triggers her ejection.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:16:27]

Yeah. She mentions her twin brother.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:31]

Pietro.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:31]

Right? Pietro.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:33]

Yeah. And she brings back just a hint just a hint of that awful well, that. But I was I was gonna say the Sokovian accent that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:41]

wanted this so terribly.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:44]

This, I think, was a nice tee up to I I have this, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:49]

hope that they will somehow bring Ultron back in this show.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:54]

Good to Because I I don't believe that he was destroyed.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:16:58]

Really?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:59]

Yeah. I think they got most of them. Right? I think they disconnected him from the net. But I I think, like, in the comics, Ultron's always coming back.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:08]

Right? Got it. So so if he's legitimately dead, that would be out of character for Ultron.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:13]

And and I would love to see that somehow become an element. Like, maybe sword, you know, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:19]

shield was tinkering around with hydra tech. Right? Maybe sword's been tinkering around with Ultron tech, and they've got, like, Ultron in a box that they're just waiting to unleash. I don't know.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:30]

Yeah. I don't know either. So the the neighbor dialogue with Vision

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:35]

is also very interesting,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:37]

and I've read some

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:38]

fan theories around all that too because he doesn't finish a sentence

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:43]

where he says we're all,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:46]

and there's speculation that everybody in

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:50]

Wanda's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:51]

Westview

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:52]

is dead.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:54]

Oh, interesting.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:56]

Interesting.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:57]

But there would still be actual people then as opposed to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:01]

just, you know, amalgamation of her mind. Yeah. Oh, I like that. I actually like that a lot. It could explain

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:07]

why

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:09]

there's so much attention on the perimeter too.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:13]

So this episode ends with Geraldine, who we know as Monica Rambo. And just to correct from last week, that is the kid from Captain Marvel. I I I screwed up when I said that. I thought it was her friend. It's it's the kid. We know it's Monica Rambo because of stuff that was announced to be for the show.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:29]

So Geraldine is like her cover inside the Wandaverse.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:33]

But she gets ejected out of like a it looks like a weird force field or something. Yep. And she's got a little bit of a red glow, so we know that Wanda has literally like thrown her out of her verse,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:46]

which is interesting too because I think I think they could play into this theory of, like, living and dead,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:52]

you know, characters.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:54]

Because Wanda can bring people back from the dead, can't she?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:59]

I don't know about that. That's a that's a characteristic.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:01]

I don't know about that. I'd have to I'd have to look into that. Yeah. Not in the comics I've read, but

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:07]

I've been focused mostly on the West Coast Adventures storyline,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:11]

which which has this Vision Quest arc, which a lot of this show is based off of. There's there's no there's no dead people being risen

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:20]

yet.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:21]

There is though in so this is kind of a tidbit maybe you you know or don't know. Vision has like a pseudo twin in the comics,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:29]

and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:31]

his name is Simon, aka Wonder Man.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:35]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:36]

there's like a there's like a his brain

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:39]

waves or whatever is like an imprint of visions.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:42]

Right? And so that's kind of interesting in the sense that, like, Wanda and Vision's kids are twins, and I'm I keep wondering if maybe what we're seeing

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:51]

with the vision there might actually be the beginning of Wonder Man. Probably not,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:57]

but I think it'd be pretty cool if they went that avenue, because it's it's a big thing in the comics. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:02]

overall,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:04]

like, dislike?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:06]

Yeah. So overall,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:09]

like, they amped up the weirdness in this episode considerably.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:14]

Still kinda playing it safe with the whole,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:18]

well, let's just throw stuff out there and keep people interested,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:21]

and still do this throwback sitcom style stuff really, really well.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:26]

So, like, there's some,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:28]

like, lost PTSD that I'm getting out of this. Like, are they gonna finish all this stuff? But Marvel historically has done a pretty good job of tying up loose ends.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:39]

So They they at least tie it up so that the story can move to the next piece. Right?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:46]

But, yeah, I I really like this episode. I'm really intrigued.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:50]

I guess time will tell

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:52]

kinda how

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:54]

how this ages.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:56]

I think that's an that's an important tidbit. Like, how does the whole show age? Because I went back I I told you the other night, I went back and I watched the original Avengers movie,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:05]

which is actually, like, really old now. You know? Right. But even going back to the first Iron Man, those movies have aged exceptionally well. Dark World still has not aged well. It didn't age well on day two.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:16]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:17]

by and large, right, Marvel movies age well, and I think that's an interesting aspect to this show. Like, what's the life out of this? I think it's interesting that we've gone through three episodes now

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:26]

of this,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:28]

like, old

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:30]

sitcom style

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:32]

time progression.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:33]

Yep. It's more it's more time than I would have expected before we find out, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:38]

what's actually going on. There's a bit of a tease there at episode three. If they don't really flesh that out in episode four, I think it's it could feel like it's dragging on, at least the sitcom element. Sure.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:48]

Granted, you have episode one is is just like pure world building. Right? Like Right. This is where they're at. I think episode two is the distance episode. Like, this is this is where we learn that Wanda's in control,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:00]

Vision has no idea what's going on,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:03]

and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:05]

they, like, are missing the history of the moment.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:09]

Right? Yep.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:11]

Episode three, I think the twins are the key component,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:14]

or they're supposed to be. I I do think that ending overshadows the twins a little bit. Sure. Like, what what is the role of the progeny moving forward in the rest of the show? Because in the trailers I've seen where Vision's running from the, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:27]

ATVs exploding and stuff around them, I don't see any twins. You know, I don't see any baby kids.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:32]

So I'm curious to see how that pans out.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:35]

I I'm

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:36]

ready for something that's not

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:39]

old tsatami, though, at this point.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:42]

Even before we hit the nineties, Stan? Come on. I mean, you know, we can go there. Right? But at at some point, we need to learn more about sword. We need an actual story around Geraldine's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:56]

Monica Rambeau's insertion into this world.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:59]

I I also think,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:01]

like, there's only six episodes left, which is not a lot of time. You know? It's it's just three hours worth of TV to explain how Wanda got there.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:09]

Is that the real vision or is he, you know, the creation of her mind? Because he died, you know. He died in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:17]

Infinity Wars.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:19]

And I I I wanna I'm I'm with you. Right? Like, I think I've got a little bit of lost PTSD

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:25]

because

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:26]

that was a great show for a long time.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:29]

They kept opening up new avenues, and they never closed enough. Right? I didn't even close them all, but I didn't close enough.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:37]

And and I I worried about that. So Oh, then it was terrible.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:42]

I haven't heard if WandaVision has a season two. I think that's the other thing that I'm curious about. As we progress, you know, will there be another run of the show?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:51]

Is is it gonna be a cliffhanger that only gets resolved in doctor strange? If that is the case, I will be really upset. Yep. I will be really upset. Because one, we don't know when doctor strange is gonna actually come out. Two,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:02]

I'm not going into the theater for a while. So so if they if Disney's adamant that their Marvel movies will only be released to theaters, we got a problem. We got a big problem.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:11]

But

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:13]

Yeah. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:14]

we shall see. I think that you're running into

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:18]

kind of the nerd element problem.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:21]

So, like, I'm not tired of the sitcom stuff yet. I still think it's super well done. Still makes me laugh,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:26]

and it's a nice sort of change of pace,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:30]

from a superhero movie. But what's the point?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:33]

What's the point? That's like What's the point of these sit sitcoms,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:37]

Stan?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:39]

Mean

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:40]

their development.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:41]

Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:45]

What was different about Wanda? Fifties Wanda versus sixties Wanda versus seventies Wanda.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:52]

So hers more

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:55]

deals with the outside world and her

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:58]

either

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:59]

pushing it off or

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:01]

becoming more open to it, which you can't really tell which one at which time. But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:07]

I don't I don't think the character develops. I think all you're seeing is the same character transplanted

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:13]

from a decade to decade with a different show. That's I'm at the most still like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:19]

really, the development is within her and Visions relationship that she missed out on initially.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:25]

Is it though?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:26]

I mean, how how's their relationship evolved?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:29]

She springs kids on him in episode three. Like, there's no intimacy that builds up to that. It's like, boom. There's suddenly kids.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:36]

If you say so, stupid. I don't know. I'm not I'm not convinced. We'll see. There's milestones that she missed out on. Like

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:43]

Well, that's true. But she missed out on in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:46]

episode one too. Right? There's when did you get married? I don't know. Right. So they made it up.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:51]

They rewrote these stories that it it allows her brain to process

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:56]

this loss in a way that she wouldn't otherwise be processing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:01]

I wanna learn more about the loss. That's the thing that I wanna get get to the bottom of. So we'll see.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:06]

Episode four,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:08]

which will put us just on the cusp of the halfway point here.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:12]

It comes out Friday.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:13]

Yeah. I kinda like that we release these episodes on Thursdays.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:17]

It's a nice recap of the last episode before

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:20]

we go and watch the next one. Well,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:23]

gotta take better notes next week, so you'll a little more on top of it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:28]

What else is going on in your world, John?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:30]

Not a lot, man. Working.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:33]

Did get some snow? We did get snow.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:36]

I snow blowed today. I think we probably got five or six inches of snow,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:40]

but it was blowing around and drifting like crazy. So there were times where it was as tall as my snowblower.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:46]

See, I'm convinced that Indiana just has the worst climate, like the worst weather in the country

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:52]

because

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:53]

it's cold. It's been rainy.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:56]

It's been cold for a long time. We don't have any snow. I thought it was little sled.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:01]

It's just ugly

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:02]

outside.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:03]

Yeah. You know, like, I mean, at at 30 some degrees, right, it's just not pleasant to be out. There's no green anymore.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:12]

There's no green. And again, without snow, like, there's nothing to do outside.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:16]

Yep. You know, what do you wanna you wanna go, like, slug through the mud on the backyard? No. Thank you. I'm good.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:22]

Don't ruin your yard, Stan. Well, there's that too. Right? Like, I don't wanna I don't wanna damage my grass. I worked so hard last fall.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:28]

So I I'm I'm itching for some snow, and I I was telling missus Lemon the other day that, you know, if we were just a little bit to the north, we'd probably have some. And if we were a whole lot further south, we'd have, like, good weather. But instead, we're we're kinda stuck in this, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:42]

you know, part of the Midwest that is in limbo for most of the year. And do want me to move there?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:48]

Yeah. Of course, I want you to move here so we can hang out. Look, it's it's really affordable. It's just the weather kinda stinks this time of the year.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:56]

And you're always complaining about traffic because they're closing different roads every week. Like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:02]

I guess not recently.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:03]

Not recently. But I I will tell you, I went to the grocery store the other day, and I went during kinda, like, a peak period of traffic.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:11]

And and as you know, they replaced all the intersections with the roundabouts as we we talked about in a previous episode.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:17]

John,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:18]

everybody was moving. Nobody was Wow. Was treating it like a four way stop. They learned about the roundabout.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:24]

I guess. Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:25]

it was such a freak miracle. I didn't know what to do with myself, but I just kept going. And so I can now if that's if that happens again,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:33]

I can make it to the grocery store in under ten minutes,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:36]

which is which is a total miracle.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:39]

I don't you know, I didn't even know what to make of it.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:43]

Well, congratulations,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:45]

Stan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:46]

Thanks, John. It's little things in life as as we've learned.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:50]

Alright, my friend. On that note, I think we'll we'll call it an episode and we'll wait until the next episode of WandaVision

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:56]

and maybe snow in Indiana.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:59]

Absolutely. Alright.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:01]

This is Stan Lemon reminding you to help control the spread of COVID nineteen. Wash your hands. Wear a mask.
