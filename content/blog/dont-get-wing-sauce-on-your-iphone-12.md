Dear Listener,

This week Stan took a field trip to try out It's Just Wings. Stan enjoys the wings with Joe, listener to the show. He starts off with smoked buffalo wings as a baseline. Listen in for his reactions, but we think he'll be back to try the fried Oreos.

Next up we talk about this week's iPhone event, new chip, new camera and updated screen. Bonus was the announcement of a HomePod mini. Stay tuned to future episodes to see if either host makes any purchases.

If you like what you hear share with a friend!

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
