Dear Listener,

This week we're joined by a very special guest who shares the places to find the best donuts in Indianapolis and weighs in on favorite Marvel Characters.

In our second segment we respond to our friend, Danchez's Apple hate.

Stan has watched a lot of movies in the last couple of months, here he talks about his favorites and tells us about his COVID-19 testing experience.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
