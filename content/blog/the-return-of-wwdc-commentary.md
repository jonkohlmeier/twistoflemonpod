Dear Listener,

Well.. we're back. If you couldn't tell from the last episode, we ran out of things to talk about back in March.

In this episode we return to discuss all things WWDC 2020. OS updates for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Watch. Firmware updates for the AirPods. Cool new tech and perhaps the biggest announcement Apple using it's own silicone in future Macs.

Thanks for tuning back in. If you have anything you want to hear us discuss let us know by visiting [the contact page](https://twistoflemonpod.com/contact/).

We'll catch you next week.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
