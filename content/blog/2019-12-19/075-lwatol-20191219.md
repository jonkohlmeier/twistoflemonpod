**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:00]

Dramas, please.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:13]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:20]

This is life

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:22]

with a twist of lemon.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:25]

Am I supposed to start?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:26]

Why not, John? Because you always start. You can't throw our listeners off. Well, I think we just did. What?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:33]

I thought you had big news you were gonna share this week. So Daniel Sanchez liked one of our episodes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:38]

Nothing to complain about. I I can't I can't believe that. That just it seems like a Christmas miracle. Apparently,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:45]

he liked how we tell people to be more productive and take breaks all in the same episode.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:51]

It's like they go hand in hand, Stan. They do. They very much do.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:55]

They very much do.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:57]

So you like completely

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:00]

cut our episode idea list in half. We're talking about the thing that I said that I don't really have anything to talk about. But I think the reason that you don't have anything to talk about it is exactly why we should talk about it. Alright.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:13]

So so this episode

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:15]

is being recorded on a Tuesday.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:17]

Yes. There's there's some news Wednesday

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:20]

that we think is related to what will happen on the day that this episode is released,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:25]

which is?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:27]

Thursday.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:28]

Yeah. The day Star Wars comes out. Yes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:31]

Day

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:32]

that Star Wars comes out. Which is only slightly true

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:36]

because technically, the release date is still Friday even though theaters start showing it at, like, 06:00 on Thursday snow. Yeah. You you can say Friday the liturgical day. The liturgical day starts at sundown.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:50]

Okay. Let's let's stick with that. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:53]

this one is a big deal because it's the conclusion to the Skywalker

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:57]

saga.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:58]

It's supposed to be conclusion to the the third trilogy.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:02]

Yeah. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:03]

it also comes on the heels of what what some have said

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:09]

is the worst

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:11]

Star Wars movie ever.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:17]

Might agree with that. Okay. I might agree with that. Well, so I bought my tickets the first night they were available,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:24]

but you did not. I did not.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:27]

Do you have tickets now? I do not.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:29]

Do you have any today?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:32]

Okay. Well, that's that's a start.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:34]

Do you

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:36]

like, you're gonna go see it, like, in theaters. Right? Yes. But at this point, probably not Thursday.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:45]

I was gonna go like 7AM on Friday,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:49]

but

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:50]

now I have a meeting at 09:00,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:52]

so can't avoid it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:54]

Well, I I don't know that you would actually I mean, maybe I was different. I don't know if you'd be able to find a ticket for a Thursday night showing at this point. I can.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:04]

A lot of them, if they're early on, is like the last scene in the theater and in the front row.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:10]

But the closer you get to midnight, things really start to open up a little bit.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:14]

And then we have like a 1AM showing, which was almost empty.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:18]

I don't know that I could do a 1AM showing. I think I too tired.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:23]

Don't know about that. So I've got tickets for the whole family at six on Thursday.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:28]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:29]

I debated on whether or not to get Evelyn a ticket, and you you, dear listener, can judge me for bringing my five year old to a Star Wars movie. She's seen every other Star Wars movie, so there's no rational world in which I, like, exclude her from this one. And then I got to thinking about it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:47]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:48]

I I would I don't know. Like, is there gonna be another opportunity

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:52]

to see a Star Wars movie on opening night? I suspect so, but it won't be a Skywalker movie. Yep.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:00]

So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:03]

yeah. So I still remember the first Star Wars movie that I saw on opening day, which was then Friday after school.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:10]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:11]

What what was the first movie

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:14]

that you saw

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:16]

in the the first Star Wars movie that you saw in theaters? In theaters was episode one, The Phantom Menace.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:22]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:23]

correct me if I'm wrong. I like, this

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:26]

because I was young,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:28]

there's a bit of a of a fuzz in my brain.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:31]

But the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:33]

original trilogy

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:35]

was remastered and re released before Phantom Menace came out. Correct? Was that before or was it after? See, this is this is where I'm fuzzy.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:44]

I I thought it was before,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:47]

but I So I distinctly remember

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:50]

seeing

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:51]

CGI Jabba the Hutt standing

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:53]

outside the Millennium Falcon in theaters.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:56]

Yeah. I I do too,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:59]

and it's just so Do you remember what movie that was?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:02]

That was A New Hope.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:04]

Yeah? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:06]

Right? Yeah. Of course, it was. You're messing with me, John. Okay. So Star Wars the special edition

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:13]

was released in 1997.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:17]

When was Phantom Menace released? '9 '9.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:20]

Alright.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:21]

So I remember seeing A New Hope

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:24]

in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:26]

the theaters

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:28]

with my mom. I don't remember going to see

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:31]

a re release of Empire

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:34]

or of,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:35]

excuse

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:37]

me,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:38]

Return of the Jedi.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:39]

They did both of those. Right? They released both of those? I have no idea, man. Like, I was in fourth grade in '99.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:46]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:48]

I'm pretty sure they did. I don't know. This is this is gonna be one of those episodes that drives Daniel Sanchez nuts.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:53]

Well, that's because he's old and remembers these things. Maybe they didn't re rerelease the others. I I'm not seeing any So I remember seeing Jabba the Hutt

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:03]

CGI

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:04]

on the big screen. Yeah. That was a new hope. They they

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:08]

added some deleted scenes, remastered some stuff. I remember there was a scene with the x wings approaching

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:16]

the Death Star that was, like, mind boggling bogglingly

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:20]

cool at the time.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:24]

And now I take it for granted when I watch it because, truth be told, I've seen the remastered or digitalized,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:30]

whatever you Normal wanna call

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:32]

one? Well, no. I've I've seen the original, but it was on a VHS, and it was Sure. You know, pre nineties. That was at least twenty years ago. Right? Like, it's just been a while. But I do remember standing in line for Phantom Menace.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:45]

Oddly enough, I think those were the only two movies I stood in line for, Star Wars movies Yeah. Until

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:52]

Force Awakens came out. Really? So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:56]

it must have been the revenge of the Sith.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:00]

I saw I was in high school, and we saw it opening night.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:04]

I think that Kevin Kate still listens. I was with him. We had a lightsaber duel in the parking lot. It was awesome, you know, back when Star Wars movies came out in May and not December.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:13]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:14]

I can only imagine a long haired high school John

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:18]

having a lightsaber duel in a parking lot. Good days. Good days. So I when I grew up, I was not a Star Wars kid. I didn't have,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:28]

much in way of Star Wars toys when I was little. When I got a little older, I bought a couple of ships because I thought they were neat.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:34]

But I wasn't really familiar with the story. I was a Star Trek guy. Yep. And I didn't get into Star Wars

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:40]

until

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:41]

and really as an adult.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:44]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:45]

I I would say

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:47]

I would say The Force Awakens really did it, and in large part because my kids got excited about it. And that led into me starting to read Star Wars books, which are, you know, especially in the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:00]

post Disney era, especially good.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:03]

I went back.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:05]

Rewatched all the movies,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:06]

learned to love Attack of the Clones

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:10]

to a certain extent,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:12]

and Revenge of the Sith, you know, heartily embrace. Still the only Phantom Menace. But then watched

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:17]

the When was the last time you gave that a real shot, Stan?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:21]

About two years ago. Two years ago? Yeah. Remember? A lot of good content in The Phantom Menace. It's just ruined by Jar Jar and the pod racing scene. Yeah. Pod racing in Jar Jar. Exactly. You you could not have

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:34]

nailed that one on the head any better than that. But, you know, then I watched the Clone Wars animated show, and ultimately, I watched Rebels as it came out. Neither of which I have watched. Yeah. And both are fantastic. So I think And they're both on Disney plus. They are. They are. You should watch them. In fact, Clone Wars is gonna get a seventh season. But Nice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:53]

I like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:55]

I don't have that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:57]

nostalgic or, like, long running love for Star Wars like a lot of my friends do.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:03]

It all is your friends are old and were alive in '77?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:07]

That's that's that's part of it, for sure. But, I mean, my love for Star Wars all been driven by my children. So Sure.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:15]

Force Awakens, right, was clearly a rip on A New Hope, and that's fine. It's it's our generation's A New Hope. It was exciting to see it in theaters. Right? Yep. And I think we talked about this. Last Jedi, was stoked for. You know, I was reading the the books that came out before and and The Gap and and all that, and, like, gearing up.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:33]

And then,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:36]

Last Jedi was terrible.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:38]

And I I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:39]

was reflecting on this too. I really liked Rogue One. Yes. I I genuinely

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:45]

love that movie.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:47]

And I think that, maybe more than anything else,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:51]

set The Last Jedi up for failure.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:55]

You think so? I do. I I I really think you did. The Force Awakens, to a certain extent,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:01]

how good that is over time

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:04]

hinged on the last Jedi

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:07]

because they

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:08]

opened up questions,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:10]

and then, like, we wanted our generation's empire,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:14]

and it didn't come. Yeah. We we did. We wanted our generation's empire.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:19]

Still the best Star Wars movie ever, hands down.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:24]

I I think I don't know. The storytelling,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:28]

the acting, the casting

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:30]

of Rogue One,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:32]

and and quite honestly, the the visuals were so excellent.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:37]

Yep. That after Rogue One, I thought

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:40]

they

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:41]

The Last Jedi has got to be better than Force Awakens. Like, it's just gonna build up. And then, yeah, there's the Empire Factor.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:48]

And I think the other thing too was

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:51]

Rian Johnson's a Star Wars nerd. Right? Right. Like, I I really didn't think that he would

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:57]

make such a catastrophic blow to the franchise, but he did.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:00]

And,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:01]

know, he

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:03]

I don't know.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:04]

Stan,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:08]

you're making me now wanna go see it even more. So solo did solo come out after last Jedi?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:14]

I think it did. So solo, I did not even see in theaters.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:18]

You have seen it since though. Right? I have I saw it when it hit Netflix,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:22]

and it was far better than I was expecting it to be. Yeah. So solo was 2018,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:27]

and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:29]

last Jedi

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:30]

was 2017.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:32]

K.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:33]

Let

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:34]

Solo was a good movie. I liked it. It it was no rogue one. That's true. And I I wouldn't even

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:43]

I would still say The Force Awakens is better than that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:46]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:47]

So So, yeah, The Force Awakens,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:50]

like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:51]

I think that partially it hinges on

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:55]

both The Last Jedi, unfortunately,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:57]

and

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:58]

whatever's gonna come out of Rise of Skywalker, which I'm very skeptical about, which means I will probably go in and love it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:05]

It could be. And, you know, like, I was thinking about this. I think I reflected this about this on the podcast. I didn't even realize it was coming out

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:12]

until the night of like, the tickets were being sold. Because you were watching Monday Night Football, weren't you? I was watching Monday Night Football, and I don't even normally watch Monday Night Football.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:21]

So there were all kinds of unusual things going on, and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:26]

I think that's just really what The Last Jedi did to Star Wars for me. Now The Mandalorian is definitely kinda

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:34]

stoking that fire a little bit and getting that going.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:37]

Yeah. The Mandalorian is interesting

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:39]

because,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:40]

like, we're in the first season,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:42]

so

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:43]

it's kinda slow overall.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:46]

It it is slow. I think that's intentional. I've I've said this before, but I think that they're kinda riffing off of the pace and pattern of A New Hope. Yeah. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:56]

that's not gonna be palatable to

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:00]

a lot of folks. Right? Like, it's not that People who are looking for a Game of Thrones replacement.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:05]

Yeah. There you go.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:09]

I or or those that like the last Star Trek movie. Right? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:14]

But I I don't know. I I think we're

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:18]

there's so much that can happen in this movie.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:21]

We've been told that it concludes

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:23]

the Skywalker saga. Like, this is the end of the line for the Skywalkers. And I've told you, I believe on this podcast,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:29]

that I believe that the only way the Skywalker saga can truly conclude is if they all die, and that includes Kylo Ren.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:35]

Correct.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:36]

The

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:38]

original tease of Emperor Palpatine has now

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:42]

snowballed into

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:44]

Yeah. Yeah. A bit more. Right? Like the last trailer,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:48]

he he basically asserts that, like, everything that's happened subsequently has been part of his plan. There's there's a little riffing on different voices as they bubble up. Yeah. So you said this was like some other scene

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:00]

in one of the animated shows.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:03]

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:04]

Of the trailers. So there's there's this moment in Clone Wars in which

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:09]

well, okay. There's actually, there's there's two moments I think of. In in Clone Wars, they do a a bit of riffing on the the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:17]

Sith and their background.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:19]

But in Rebels, there's this instance where

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:23]

Kanan

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:24]

and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:25]

it's Ezra? Man, my mind's blinking me. And Ahsoka Tano

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:29]

duke it out with Vader

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:31]

at a Sith temple,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:33]

and it's the Sith temple

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:35]

that looks familiar to me in the last scene

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:38]

that we saw in that last trailer.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:40]

So you don't think it's the Dagobah Cave?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:44]

I don't. I I I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:47]

mean, it's a you know, that like, it's a fair guess. It could be something going on in Dagobah. I I totally would not be shocked by that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:54]

I've long suspected that Dagobah is is, home to a Sith temple.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:58]

But,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:59]

in order to mask the the presence of Yoda

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:03]

Sure. There.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:04]

But I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:05]

I don't know. I think I think if this movie

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:09]

is to be successful,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:11]

they're going to toss nerds like me who have just entrenched themselves in the Star Wars world some softballs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:19]

Yep. And they'll get missed by most

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:23]

people.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:23]

And that's okay as long as the movie, when those are missed, still stands on its own. And I think

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:30]

I think that's where Rogue One really knocked it out of the park. Yep.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:34]

I'm with you, man. It's all go.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:37]

I will go before we record next.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:39]

So Yeah. You better because this that'll be the movie like to cover it all. I I I don't know. You know,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:47]

I I think it's gonna be hard for this one to be worse than The Last Jedi.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:52]

Yeah. Could be famous last words, I think the bar was set so incredibly Well, and we're walking in with low expectations this time too. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's very true. So But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:02]

I'm I'm expecting emperor Palpatine

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:04]

to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:05]

make an appearance, right, more than just a voice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:08]

More than the cave? More than just the cave. Yeah. Okay. I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:12]

am anticipating

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:14]

an epic battle.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:16]

I I I don't think it'll be as simple as

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:20]

the light winning out.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:23]

I think what's more likely to happen is that there will be some kind of equalization

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:27]

in in both sides of to the force. Yeah. Like, legit balance. Right? Because

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:33]

the at least in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:35]

the Skywalker saga thus far, we have actually not known balance. Right? It's always been lopsided.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:41]

So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:16:42]

Interesting. I see. So you remember the the Death Star ruins

**SPEAKER_1** [00:16:47]

in it must have been the first trailer? Yep. Do you think that that is a fully operational battle station?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:54]

I no.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:57]

So it has to be the second death star in my opinion. I don't think it could be the first or

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:04]

Well, the first one just kinda blows up. Right? I guess they both want. But

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:08]

one is above and or. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:11]

I I don't know. It's so in in the books, the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:16]

the remains

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:18]

of the Death Star are, like, harvested to construct ships and stuff. But I think all of those books are now pre canon, so they they probably

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:27]

don't count.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:29]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:30]

don't know. We'll

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:31]

see. I it's such a large section of the Death Star. It just doesn't seem consistent with the way we've seen them explode.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:38]

Sure.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:40]

But I'm hoping for some deep mystic roots in this one.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:44]

I think we've we've not had a lot of that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:48]

in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:49]

either The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi. Like, there's a little bit of it in the tree, but then they kinda laughed it off. And I'd like to see them dig in more on that and kinda, you know, wrap that up with a bow.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:00]

But I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:01]

don't know. You think they're gonna be porgs in this one?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:06]

No. I think they probably would have made a trailer by now.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:09]

I I hope the porgs come back. I really do. I'd I'd love to see I like them more than ewoks.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:15]

Oh, I don't know about that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:18]

But I like, I'd love to see them take a weird crazy twist where, like, the porgs are actually Sith Lords in hiding or something like that. There you go. Yeah. Like Darth Jar Jar. There you go. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:29]

That would explain so much.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:32]

It'll be interesting to see too how many of the fan theories get some

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:36]

treatment because that was one of the criticisms

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:39]

of The Last Jedi. Right? They didn't cater to any fan theories.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:42]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:43]

in particular, think it was, like, who

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:46]

who is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:47]

raised parents. Right? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:50]

She's a nobody, and that that was not palatable to anyone.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:54]

Kinda like when Luke gets the lightsaber and tosses it over the cliff.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:00]

Yeah. Exactly. Coming off like, that just just

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:04]

how that tone was set for the beginning of the movie after the closing helicopter shot, which is not great cinematically,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:11]

but it meant a lot.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:13]

Yeah. Well, it was just it was an awkward

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:16]

transition,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:17]

and they they worked so hard to make you hate Luke Skywalker,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:22]

you know? Yeah. And and I I don't I don't I don't think that worked for them. I really don't. I think it backfired a little bit, especially since he winds up being the hero in the end. Right.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:33]

So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:34]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:35]

Oh, well. Won't be talking about John? My biggest fear. I'm not that invested in it right now.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:43]

My my biggest fear is that it ends on a cliffhanger.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:47]

And so so this thing that supposedly is going to conclude does not. That's my biggest So it's JJ Abrams. Right? He's directing this one? Yeah. And he's I mean So you saw Lost. Right? Yeah. Don't even get me started. Started. You would give all a dream.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:01]

Yeah. Like, it's in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:03]

Mickey Mouse's dream. Well, you know, it's funny that you say that because the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:09]

script I I can't remember what they're called now.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:12]

The the A New Hope kicks off the wills. Is that what it is? The Journal of the Wills, something like that? Yeah. The story is told

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:21]

by this other creature. I'm pretty sure it's the the Journal of the Wills.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:26]

Alright.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:27]

I thought that you were gonna go from a certain point of view, but that's not what you were talking about. No.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:33]

The story gets told though from another creature as if it's like a story. And they teased a little bit of that in Clone Wars. They dabbled with it a little bit. And actually, if you remember,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:43]

in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:44]

Rogue One,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:46]

the temple where the blind guy I'm drawing a blank on his name now.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:50]

He was your favorite character for a while. Yeah. Oh, he's awesome. He's got he's got the best lines.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:56]

But that also makes an appearance on the one of the buildings that he's at. There's like a temple for them. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:04]

who knows? Maybe maybe it does all wind up becoming a dream, just like Lost.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:08]

I hope not, but

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:12]

I don't know, man. I just don't know.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:15]

I think I've got that right, the wills. I'll have look that up. Yeah. Journal of the wills.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:19]

Yep. Never heard of it. After the galactic civil war. Yep.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:24]

So our listeners probably know this already, but when you go in on something, you go all in on that thing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:30]

I'd well.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:33]

Everything from baking bread to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:37]

I'm not gonna deny it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:41]

I don't care that much. In other news, this

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:44]

will come out after this happens, but Disney Plus is doing something weird this week Yeah. Where they are releasing

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:51]

The Mandalorian

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:52]

early. And I there are two theories that I'm aware of as to why they're doing this.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:57]

One is everyone will be at the theater on Friday

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:00]

and they want people to still see the episode. That's like the simple purely commercial

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:06]

reason So there's also a sneak peek to look to the movie

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:11]

that will air after the credits.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:14]

Oh, interesting. Yeah. Okay. So if you don't want a spoiler, maybe don't watch through the credits.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:20]

That's not that's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:22]

not beneath me.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:23]

But there there's also been some

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:26]

theories floating around the Internet, and this was my original assumption too,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:30]

that there will be some nugget in the Mandalorian

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:33]

that will play into

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:36]

the Rise of Skywalker.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:38]

Do you think that that'll be the case?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:40]

I hope so. I mean, Mandalorian has taken place, what, like, years before Rise of Skywalker?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:46]

'25. '25?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:48]

Sure. Yes.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:50]

What's the new year? Years have like, it was thirty years to

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:55]

The Force Awakens.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:56]

How many years have passed since then?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:59]

We

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:00]

don't really have a good clear time between The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, but I don't believe we're led to think it's been very long.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:08]

K. Right?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:09]

So you can go away and train to become a Jedi?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:13]

Well, I mean, this this kinda plays in that question. How long did it take for Clean Empire and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:19]

Well, Empire and and Force Awakens is thirty years. Right? And Empire Mandalorian is five. That's we've been given that much Sure. Data. So I'm gonna say twenty five ish years. K. Sure.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:31]

So it has to be something that

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:33]

will play into it with that time accounted for. Something that lingers.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:39]

I I tell you what, one thing I would Wait. Wait. I know what it is, Stan.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:43]

It's secret plans

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:45]

to a super weapon for the First Order.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:51]

Like a like a hint at the end of Revenge of the Sith? Right. Yeah. Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:59]

I'm I'm hoping for something a little deeper than that. I would love to see a Mandalorian in Rise of Skywalker, but I don't think that'll happen.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:06]

So Nope.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:09]

Maybe was

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:10]

it Pedro Pascal? Is that that's his name?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:13]

Oberyn from

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:15]

Game of Thrones, The Mandalorian.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:17]

Maybe he'll show up with his helmet off in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:20]

Rise of Skywalker.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:21]

But Maybe.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:23]

Alright, John. Next question. Do you have your Christmas tree up? No.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:27]

When will you put your Christmas tree up? Probably this weekend.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:30]

Oh, okay. That's actually sooner than I would have figured. I was kinda counting on the December 26 for you. December 26? No. I would have it up on the twenty fourth at the latest if I was going to put it up. If it's not up on the twenty fourth at the latest, then it will not go up that year.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:44]

So have you had years where you didn't put up a Christmas tree at all?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:49]

Probably.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:50]

Okay. So Have you had years since you've been married

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:53]

where you didn't put up a Christmas tree? So our Christmas tree came from you guys because missus Lemon wanted a new one.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:01]

Well,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:02]

technically, at that point, she'd already acquired the new one, but yes. Oh, that's true. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:09]

we put up a Christmas tree last year as the first Christmas in our house.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:15]

You definitely put it apartment.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:17]

Yeah. There might have been one year where we didn't put it up in the apartment.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:21]

So when will you start playing Christmas music?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:24]

That has already happened. I had some Michael Buble Christmas music on

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:29]

over the weekend.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:30]

That's a that's a good album.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:32]

I'm surprised because you were pretty,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:36]

judgmental,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:38]

I will say, that I was already busting out the, Christmas jams. Like I said, when you do something, you go all in.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:46]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:48]

this weekend my it's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:50]

if you've followed my wife on Facebook, you'll know that she is not a fan of Mary Did You Know. She does not like that song at all.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:59]

And I did not realize until recently

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:02]

that there are many, many, many versions of Mary Did You Know. So I recently created a playlist, John, of Mary Did You Know. I put it on, did not let missus Lemon know.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:13]

And it would say, Sarah Lemon did not know.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:16]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:18]

it it drove her completely mental.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:21]

So I've been full swing though in the Christmas music for at least a week, week and a half. I've got my twenty nineteen Christmas playlist curated. You can find it in iTunes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:30]

Wanna send me a link to that and then we'll post it with this episode? I don't know that I know how to find it, but I will I will do my best. Alright.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:38]

Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:38]

what you're asking is for a

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:41]

a playlist

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:42]

link out of iTunes and I just is that even a thing? I have no idea. I don't use iTunes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:48]

Yeah. It's it's really sad.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:49]

Oh, here we go, John. I found a link, so you can post this Don't worry. On So all of our Apple Music fans can see what's on Stan's Christmas

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:58]

playlist.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:59]

You you'll find that it's mostly

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:02]

acapella stuff with some ninety degrees and Trace Adkins mixed in. Nice.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:07]

Yeah. Did you know that I saw a ninety eight degrees in concert once?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:11]

I did not. Do you tell me more?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:13]

So, like, I had to have been, like, middle school age. And I went with my sister Liz and her friend Anna and my aunt Sue,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:22]

and we went and saw them at

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:24]

one of the venues in Chicago. What's the other big arena in Chicago that's not the United Center?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:29]

Oh, I don't I don't know. They they changed the names. I'd I wouldn't be able to say what it was. So it was there, and it was like some

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:36]

Nickelodeon

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:37]

festival thing that had all these boy bands. Nickelodeon

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:41]

festival. I don't know what it was, but

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:44]

excellent.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:44]

Excellent.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:47]

Of

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:48]

the boy band genre,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:50]

ninety degrees is unequivocally

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:52]

my favorite.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:53]

I'm not ashamed. Yeah. I'm not ashamed to admit that either.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:56]

And I still will enjoy,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:59]

like, putting on the 90 degrees and rising album. That one that one never gets old for me.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:06]

This surprises me, Stan. Don't think I knew this about you. Why does that surprise you, John? I feel like you're usually gravitating towards NSYNC.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:14]

Well, everybody plays NSYNC even twenty years later. You know? Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:19]

nobody busts out because of you and just starts playing it by 90 degrees. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:23]

Or the hardest thing. Like, when was the last time you heard somebody play the hardest thing? I'm sure it was probably with you. Oh, I do cherish you. I mean, these are these are all great jams, but they, for whatever reason,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:34]

don't have the longevity that, you know, NSYNC's Bye Bye Bye has. In fact, does anybody ever play anything from the first NSYNC album?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:44]

Probably. But I would have to look up what was on the first NSYNC album. I can't say that I ever owned any of them.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:50]

Well, I I cannot

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:52]

sit here and deny that I didn't own them.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:55]

Tearing up my heart, I mean Yeah. Surely everybody knows that or I want you back. It was also on that first album.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:01]

There's some other good ones.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:03]

Trying I'm to think. God must have spent a little more time on Oh, yeah. Yeah. That still gets played at weddings and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:09]

Such a cheesy cheesy song.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:13]

But yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:17]

But honorable mention

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:19]

in the boy band world

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:21]

are the light funky ones.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:23]

Oh, LFO. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:25]

They have more than one song. I don't know. But if you've ever seen if you haven't ever seen Stan and I sing every word to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:33]

summer girls, you're really missing out. Oh, for sure. For sure. So before we completely digress into an awful place,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:41]

I will just say ninety degrees has two Christmas albums, and they are genuinely good and and highly recommend them.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:49]

So There was

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:51]

some, like, kiss me at midnight,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:54]

New Year's song that was on a Christmas album by some boy band,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:58]

but I don't remember who it was. Was that what it was called? Kiss me at midnight? I think that's the name of the song.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:03]

Oh, that's NSYNC. That's off their that's off NSYNC's Christmas album. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which which isn't bad. It's not as good, but it's it's it's not bad. That's the one with Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I remember seeing them do that in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade back when we watched that thing. They probably lip synced it, but I think everybody is.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:25]

And then

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:26]

that also has the Home for Christmas Jam, which was,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:30]

you know, pretty good too. Just because because I'm on a roll. Mariah Carey has a pretty good Christmas album too. I think that one's like classic at this point because that's the '94

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:40]

Mariah Carey album.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:42]

K.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:44]

What's that song that they always play of hers? Like, it's really annoying. All I Want For Christmas You? Yeah. You like that one? Oh, of course, John. That's a classic. See, this is where Christmas music annoys me. What? Oh, man. You're so sour.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:00]

Scrooge.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:01]

I am Scrooge.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:02]

So I don't like Christmas until the twenty fifth.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:06]

On on my Christmas playlist is a

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:11]

what's hold on. Let me find out what it's called. This is gonna drive me nuts. It's called Green Christmas by Barenaked Ladies from the Doctor Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas album. Nice. It's fantastic. Highly recommend it. I also have

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:25]

Grinch 2,000

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:27]

starring Buster Rhymes and Jim Carrey.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:30]

Wow. Which yeah. You'll you'll love that one. And then

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:33]

lest lest there be any doubt that I'm old,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:37]

Christmas in Hollis by Run DMC. Have you ever heard that one? I have. I think that is my father in law's favorite Christmas song. Oh, it's that's just a classic.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:46]

This year, I will say

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:49]

new additions to my list. John Legend has a Christmas album out this year. Pretty good. Yeah. I didn't pull Just him and the piano? Because that would be awesome.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:58]

Well, he did, like, What Christmas Means To Me featuring Stevie Wonder. You you can't go you can't go wrong there. Right? Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:04]

that's just that's gonna come out awesome.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:06]

Idina Menzel has a album that's pretty good. She's gotta do it with Michael Buble on there, so you might I like that listened to that when I had the robot from Amazon play Michael Buble Christmas music. Oh, okay. There you go. And then Alicia Keys dropped the single,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:24]

the Christmas song. That it's, you know, it's not bad. I liked it, so I'd recommend Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:32:30]

There you go. Those are the kind of the top Sand lemon Christmas. So what are you doing? Do you have any Christmas traditions

**SPEAKER_1** [00:32:37]

besides playing Christmas music?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:32:39]

Do you open gifts on Christmas Eve or something like that? Turn on the fireplace, drink hot cocoa?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:45]

We do gifts after church on Sunday or excuse me, on Christmas day rather. K.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:51]

So we'll we'll do

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:53]

the the stockings before we leave.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:56]

You'll hang the stockings by the chimney with care? No. Nobody nobody actually does that because you requires legitimate hooks

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:03]

in your mantle, and nobody wants to do that. We get the clip ons, so the stock the stockings are hanging now. But when they get filled up, they will be set on the floor.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:13]

And we'll hope that neither the dog nor the robo vacuum eats them up before

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:19]

it's it's game time for the kids to open them up. Fair enough. I should find my stocking. I don't have a chimney. But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:27]

Well, I mean, we can bet if we have a chimney for the longest time and we still still

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:32]

have stockings.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:34]

Okay.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:36]

Do you have a big Christmas feast

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:39]

or just whatever you make? Well, it's been different year to year because different things are going on. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:46]

when we've had people here, we've made stuff. I think last year we had people here.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:51]

I think my family was here last year.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:53]

It's funny how things kinda blur over time. I'm I'm pretty sure my family was here last year.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:58]

We've had, you know, Sarah's folks up. We've also just done meals by ourselves.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:03]

Quite honestly, this year, Sarah being organized at church. Yeah. That will make you hate Christmas real fast.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:10]

We may come home and just

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:12]

eat up some leftover pizza. We'll have to see. There you go. Nothing wrong with that. You can shape the pepperonis like a Christmas tree.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:19]

That sounds like a lot of work. I I don't I don't see that. How's that any more work than spreading the pepperonis normally?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:27]

Oh, spread them in the shape of a Christmas tree. Yeah. What you meant, like, pre cutting them to be shaped like Christmas That's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:33]

crazy, Stan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:35]

It's it's not the worst idea I've heard though.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:39]

Cookie cutters.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:41]

Yeah. But you have to you have to either get really big pepperoni

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:44]

or really small cookie cutters.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:47]

Both of which exist.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:48]

That's that's true, I guess. That's true. What about you, John? So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:53]

I'm canceling Christmas this year. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:58]

scroogey.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:59]

I am what? We're ten days out, and I have no idea what I'm doing. We will be here, just Anna and I

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:06]

John. Christmas Eve and Christmas You're

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:08]

not ten days out, buddy.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:11]

You're eight days out. Come on. Alright.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:14]

I haven't done any Christmas shopping yet.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:17]

Wait. Really? Really?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:19]

Wow. I'm done. I'm completely done. Good job, Stan. Did you do it all on Amazon?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:25]

A good portion of it, but I I had to, you know, buy from some other online shopping places. I did I have not been into a store yet,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:32]

and, that's okay. I'm I'm really okay with that.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:36]

Am I supposed to be expecting a lemon mug? I have a package that's leaving from Indianapolis today,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:42]

but it's not from you. From Indianapolis?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:45]

Apparently, you have a Warby Parker warehouse

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:47]

there.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:48]

Oh, interesting.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:51]

There is no lemon mug this year. No lemon mug this year? No lemon mug this year. That's sad.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:57]

Is something for

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:59]

you, John. Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:01]

There's there's something coming for you. It is not a lemon mug, and that is all I will say. Did Beutto make a list?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:36:07]

Wait. Make what list? Oh, it's just for me?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:10]

Yeah. John, your your gift is unique this year.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:36:14]

Oh, no. Does it go with my birthday gift?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:17]

No. No. No. That'd be funny.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:19]

No. I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:20]

so for whatever reason, I didn't take a lot of selfies this last year, and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:25]

I got I got some

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:27]

mixed feedback on the last mug.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:30]

So You did go off the beaten path. Yeah. Well, you know, I try to mix up and and people I don't know. They just can't handle change.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:37]

So so we canceled the mug this year.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:40]

I I won't say that we've canceled indefinitely. Maybe it'll make a comeback next year, but at least for the time being, there is no there is no 2019

**SPEAKER_1** [00:36:49]

mug. What did you get for your mother?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:36:51]

You can't say that because it's yours before Christmas.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:54]

So remember,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:55]

a couple years back, she asked me not to give her a mug with all my pictures because Right. I guess one picture really bothered her on one of the mugs Only one? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:07]

I don't know. It really troubled her. She asked for no more mugs, so I I didn't send her. But it was one one year, I did I did get an a set of ornaments, 12 ornaments that you could insert pictures into, you know, you know I'm talking about like the Yeah. Yeah. Circular flat ones, the glass ones, and you could pop pictures in, and we took just selfies of me and put those in 12 ornaments and sent them to her.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:29]

Nice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:30]

Yeah. I wonder if she kept those.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:33]

But at least that year, she put them on a small tree like a desk tree Nice. And called it her Stan tree. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:37:42]

Now that's clever Stan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:44]

I what I'd like to do at some point,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:47]

is make t shirts with my face on them. There you go.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:37:51]

High quality t shirts.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:53]

No. No. I I I think I think they should look like something out of the seventies, be really really cheesy and corny. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:01]

I I won't give them to anybody wrapped. I'm gonna use one of those

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:05]

t shirt guns and I'll just shoot them at people.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:08]

That's that's my Next

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:10]

time you go to Atlanta.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:11]

Yeah. There you go.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:13]

Alright, John. Well, look, I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:15]

I'm looking forward to the next time that we talk having watched Star Wars twice

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:20]

by the time we record again. How early are we gonna have to record, Stan?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:24]

Well, we'll we'll probably record Monday or Tuesday. Right? So you got you got a couple Tuesday is Christmas Eve. So Oh, alright. Well, then

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:32]

that won't work. We'll record Monday night. Alright.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:36]

Monday night it's already on the calendar. So by Monday night, you gotta watch Star Wars at least once. Like I said, I I I'm gonna see it twice, John. So Right. I've I've already got tickets. Have stronger opinions about things than I do anyway, and a better memory, and all this background knowledge that I have no knowledge of.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:53]

Just just take a notebook. Take notes. Do it for the sake of the podcast. Alright.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:58]

On that note, we'll see you next week. Maybe we'll air some grievances and stuff like that. Oh. May the force be with you. And also with you.
