Dear Listener,

Danchez liked our last episode! Nothing to complain about.

On that note we jump into a topic that we're sure he'll have strong opinions on. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - which is said to be the conclusion of the Skywalker Saga.

Jon doesn't have tickets yet. It releases this evening.

Jon also doesn't have a Christmas Tree up. Stan has been playing Christmas music for weeks, you can get a feel for his Christmas music tastes.

Thanks for listening - Let us know what you think of The Rise of Skywalker!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
