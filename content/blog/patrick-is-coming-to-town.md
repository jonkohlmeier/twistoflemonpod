Dear Listener,

Today we have breaking news regarding Avengers 4: Endgame. We're excited and we can't wait.

That leads us into a conversation on web design including [spacejam.com](https://spacejam.com), [marvel.com/captainmarvel](https://marvel.com/captainmarvel), and [airforce.com](https://airforce.com).

You'll never guess what comes next. Milkshake reviews! Jon had 2 milkshakes in the last week. One from Cold Stone Creamery in Cedar Rapids and one from Julie Ann's Frozen Custard in Crystal Lake, IL. Stan visited a different Five Guys in Fort Wayne, IN.

Finally we talk about about the state of online banking especially Wealthfront and their opening of cash accounts. How do we use banks?

If you're interested in Wealthfront use this link: [http://wlth.fr/1eAorix](http://wlth.fr/1eAorix) You'll get $5k of assets managed for free and you'll help Jon get $5k of assets managed for free.

Thanks for Listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
