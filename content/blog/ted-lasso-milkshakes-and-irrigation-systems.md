Dear Listener,

Taliesin went in for his big surgery, so we talk about his cone of shame and that experience as a dog owner.

Jon finally started watching Ted Lasso, so we can actually talk about it on the podcast.

We also feature a milkshake review in this episode! From Frydae in Marion, IA.

Stan's irrigation system was finally installed! We talk about that experience and how it will take his lawn game to the next level.

Stick around for our last post-credit scene

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
