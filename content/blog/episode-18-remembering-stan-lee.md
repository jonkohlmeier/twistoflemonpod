Dear Listener,

You can measure short distances on Google Maps! That tip alone is worth listening to this episode.

A new Italian Beef place opened up in Cedar Rapids, I give my review (unfortunately no milkshakes on the menu). Stan describes what an Italian beef is, because apparently they're kind of a regional thing.

Stan Lee died this week, we remember the creator of Marvel and spend some time talking about his work.

I voted... and started more political talk. The episode is saved with a Jon Moving Update. Stan is surviving life and the Lemon house doesn't appear to be falling apart this week.

Listen in, have fun, write a review on iTunes: we'll be talking about some on air next week!

Talk to you later,

Jon Kohlmeier
