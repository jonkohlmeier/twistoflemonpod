Dear Listener,

Stan got some Goodr sunglasses. He talks about that, which leads into some talk on Blues Brothers.

Jon gives an update on everything post-derecho. And Stan gives an update on his home additions.

Please like and share with your friends!

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
