Dear Listener,

Today is Mrs. Lemon's birthday! Happy birthday Mrs. Lemon! Thanks for taking care of Stan.

No new reviews this week. Which means you, dear listener, should leave us a review.

Stan christened his brand new meat smoker over the weekend. Listen in as Stan talks about his experience with the smoker and how it all turned out.

We're both Star Trek fans so we can't let the new trailer for the new Picard series. We talk about lots of things Star Trek and how we're excited about Patrick Stewarts return to Captain Picard.

WWCD is coming up. Stan gives his predictions on what will be announced and what he's excited for.

Finally Stan gives Jon a hard time for still not having a ladder.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
