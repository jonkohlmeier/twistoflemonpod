Dear Listener,

Stan is trying to figure out what kind of headphones to buy. September is turning out to be expensive for him due to the tech toy purchases.

In the mission to try and review milkshakes and weird menu items (like the impossible whopper.) Jon felt the need to order Pizza Hut's new Stuffed Cheeze It pizza. In the end it's probably worth trying.. but Jon won't order again.

To burn of the extra calories Stan and Jon have been doing lawn work. We talk about the next steps for Jon's lawn and Stan's recent lawn woes.

There's been an increase of use in paper organizers. Stan seems to think it's nostalgia for the old school trapper keepers.

We talk about iOS 13, introduce Stan to the measure app and talk about how Stan is liking his new apple devices.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
