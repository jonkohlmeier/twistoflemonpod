Dear Listener,

Stan and Jon reflect on the Super Bowl that Jon didn't watch. Jon is happy that now everyone thinks that football is as boring as he thought for years.

National Pizza day is Saturday February 9th. You'll want to listen to this discussion to learn Stan's secrets to delicious pizza.

Finally, this week Jon listened to Weezer and convinced Stan to listen as well. We talk the Blue Album and the Teal album.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier

P.S. - Jon's audio quality is terrible. We'll get it fixed.

"You don't have to listen to the show to leave a review. You don't have to listen to the show to give it 5 stars. In fact, if you don't listen you're more likely to give it 5 stars!" - Stanley C. Lemon.
