Dear Listener,

In the last week Jon has closed on his house, cleaned carpets, finished packing and made the big move! Listen in to these last steps of the home purchase.

Happy Thanksgiving - We talk through their thanksgiving plans and read through some iTunes reviews (you should leave one too!).

Finally, Stan alludes to a special announcement. Be sure to tune in next week for our exciting campaign.

We hope that you start a new Thanksgiving tradition of drinking milkshakes!

See you next week,

\- Jon Kohlmeier
