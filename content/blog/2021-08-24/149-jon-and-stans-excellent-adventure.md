Dear Listener,

Jon made another trip to Indianapolis for a couple of days with the primary objective of kegging the beer that was brewed over the 4th of July weekend.

Stan managed to plan a bunch of other fun stuff like trimming trees, spreading fertilizer, eating, smoking meat, and eating some more. Of course we had to work in some cycling and tennis to burn off some of those extra calories.

Listen in to hear all about it and tune in next week to celebrate our 150th episode!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
