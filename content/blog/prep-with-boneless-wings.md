Dear Listener,

"Boneless" Thugs N Harmony is making a promo video for Buffalo Wild Wings. We talk about Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Stan's history with BW's and why you can probably make better wings at home.

No sound bite from Fenker for this week, but Stan has a pretty good excuse for why he couldn't make it happen.

Stan has a post-Disney shoe update for us. He seems happier with them now that they've been broken in.

Finally, Stan has started prepping. He's now ready to survive a Zombie apocalypse or mutant strains of coronavirus.

If you like what you hear please leave us a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
