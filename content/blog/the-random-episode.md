Dear Listener,

Stan thinks we're scraping the bottom of the barrel for this episode. The first item on the list was current favorite song.

There's a new Black Widow trailer out what they're calling the "Final Trailer" We talk about new things in the trailer. We're looking forward to it with cautious optimism.

We briefly cover tree trimming and Grilled cheese anniversary. We also have no 2020 podcast reviews.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
