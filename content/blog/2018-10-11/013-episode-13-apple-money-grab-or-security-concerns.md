Dear Listener,

Today we kick off the episode arguing semantics. Stan has yet another milkshake story. He attends a place with "Shake" in the name and is underwhelmed.

Regular listener Tom, sent us an article via twitter for our (read: Stan's) opinion. Hear us opine on the lockdown of Apple repairs.

This leads to a broader discussion on security and data privacy of all kinds.

Stan checks in on the Kohlmeier home buying adventure which leads into a discussion on 30 year vs 15 year mortgage.

If you like what you hear, leave us a review on iTunes.

Thanks!

\- Jon Kohlmeier
