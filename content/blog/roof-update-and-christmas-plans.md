Dear Listener,

Merry Christmas! This week we reflect on a 2 hour episode. And get an update on Stan's Steelers.

Apparently people ask Stan about how Jon's roof is doing. In this episode you get a roof update.

Finally we talk about our Christmas plans and wish you our dear listener a merry Christmas.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
