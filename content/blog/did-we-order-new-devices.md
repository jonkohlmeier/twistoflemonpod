Dear Listener,

This week we talk about our decision making process and if we ordered any new Apple devices after last week's Apple event. Listen in to here if and what each of us purchased.

We also talk about iOS and iPadOS 15 which released the day we recorded this.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
