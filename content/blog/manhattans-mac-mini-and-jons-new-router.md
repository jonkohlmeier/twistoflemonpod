Dear Listener,

We kick off the episode talking about Manhattans which turns into a Milkshake check-in.

We review and comment on some listener comments. Angie left a comment with some suggestions for our 2020 resolutions/goals.

Stan continues his trend of getting rid of things that no longer bring him joy. He gave up his old faithful Mac Mini that he's had since 2011.

Stan wants to know if I use an ad blocker. Stan recommends Ghostery.

Jon also got a new router! Stan hasn't said anything for the last month and half, so Jon had to bring it up.

We wrap up by talking about what we're watching.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
