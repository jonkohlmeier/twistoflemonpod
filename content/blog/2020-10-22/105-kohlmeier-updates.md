Dear Listener,

This week is full of updates about Jon's life. We kick off the episode by actually saying who we are and asking you to share the episode if you like it!

Stan has questions about instagram which leads into a discussion about end of season lawn care, roof updates and Aldi having cherries.

Fenker has kicked off [thebbqrev.com](https://thebbqrev.com) and his second post ever was recommending Kohlmeier a cooker for smoking meat of his own.

Thanks for listening! If you like what you hear please leave a review and share with a friend.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
