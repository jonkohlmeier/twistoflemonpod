Dear Listener,

Turns out our friend Joe doesn't like wings, but Aaron Fenker has shipped his hamburger seasoning to us!

Stan blew his daughters mind by having the Donut Fairy visit the house.

Finally we get into the meat of the episode with our review of the new iOS and watchOS updates. We cover the good the bad and the underwhelming.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
