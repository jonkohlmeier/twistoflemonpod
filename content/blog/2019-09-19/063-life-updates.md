Dear Listener,

This turned out to be a sort of catch up in the life of Jon and Stan episode. Stan is having some football woes which leads to a lament to kick off the episode.

Stan didn't add a lot to our list of talking points. So Jon added random things including an EcoBee update, reading updates and bicycling updates.

There's also considerable talk of fire in this episode, Jon's lesson learned while grilling, what kind of gas can he should buy and more.

Finally we talk about prioritization and queuing.

Listen in - let us know if you have ideas for us to talk about.

Thanks!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
