Dear listener,

Stan is liking Jon's new look - shaped beard, new glasses and all. Jon tells about his experience getting new glasses from Warby Parker.

The rest of the episode is spent discussion Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. This episode includes many many many spoilers. So stop the episode if you don't want anything to be spoiled.

Thanks for listening!
