Dear Listener,

This week we cover a listener requested topic and muse on the worst technology that we've ever owned. This ranges from mobile devices, to operating systems and other hardware. Listen in for (mostly old) tech you should avoid as we stroll down memory lane.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
