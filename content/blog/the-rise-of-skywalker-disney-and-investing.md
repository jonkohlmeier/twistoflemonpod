Dear Listener,

This week we kick off the episode explaining why we were recording early again. For both Game of Thrones and because it's Holy Week.

Disney rebased some big announcements that we give our take on. We're both excited for Disney+ and the content to come with it.

Which leads directly into the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker teaser discussion. We have a new hope after this teaser.

Finally Jon asks Stan about his new investing strategy and Stan gives us more information than we could have ever dreamed of.

Thanks for listening in!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier

P.S. Sorry Jon's audio is so bad. Looks like Audio Hijack picked up the wrong input source.
