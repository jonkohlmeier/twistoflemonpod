Dear Listener,

Jon and Mrs. Kohlmeier are headed to visit LemonLand this week, tune in for more on those adventures.

Most of this episode is spent sharing our listeners ranking of Fast Food (apparently our lists caused some disagreement.)

Listen in, enjoy, and share with a friend.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier

P.S. If you'd like to hear about Loki, stick around for the post credits segment.
