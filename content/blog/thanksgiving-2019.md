Dear Listener,

Stan's kids have been introduced to Boy Meets World. We have a practical life tip for everyone living in cooler climates.

We spend the majority of this episode talking about all things Thanksgiving.

Listen in and we hope that you have a great Turkey-Day.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
