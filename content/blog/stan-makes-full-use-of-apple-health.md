Dear Listener,

This week we speculate about the Apple WWDC invite and what announcements might be coming at the June event. After that we find out that Stan uses Apple Health far more than any of us knew.

From there we find out that Stan also has an overly complicated schedule on his Ecobees.

Finally, Jon complains about streaming services and having to subscribe to 6 of them just to be able to watch what he wants.
