Dear Listener,

We're not sure if we'll keep posting on Tuesdays, but I guess we'll see. This week we're realizing on Tuesday again so you can hear our first reactions on Loki before the next episode.

If you want to hear Mrs. Lemon and Mrs. Kohlmeier on the podcast let us know with your best persuasive reasons why!

We have some brief follow up on Apple Spacial audio and some other news from WWDC on the developer side - including Stan's 5 minutes of fame!

Finally we go all in on Loki and we're pretty happy with episode 1.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
