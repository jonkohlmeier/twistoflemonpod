Dear Listener,

Stan kicks off this episode asking for an update on the iPhone after having it for 1 week. Then we jump into discussing Shang-Chi (Now that it hit Disney+ so we could watch it.)

Finally we have a conversation about social media history and ephemeral content.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
