Dear Listener,

If you want to hear us talk about milkshakes for an abnormal amount of time, you won't want to miss this episode! Stan kicks off the episode talking about his day trip to Fort Wayne and how there are now places to eat. We follow up on our milkshake discussion with some milkshake recommendations and milkshakes to avoid. Finally the Lemon turns sour and lets out his anger against Twitter and their killing of his favorite Twitter apps.

As a bonus you'll hear about Jon's new Mac, Stan's first experience watching the Lord of the Rings films, Baby Got Brunch, and more!

We hope you enjoy and share this episode with anyone you think might find it interested.

Sincerely,

LWaToL Hosts
