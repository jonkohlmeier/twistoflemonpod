Dear Listener,

Jon brings some normalcy back to 2020 with a milkshake tasting! Then we talk about customer support, and Jon's Xbox Saga.

Stan has uncovered some bugs in Big Sur but is loving the HomePod Mini.

Finally we talk about Thanksgiving meals and what our favorite sides are.

Listen in and share with a friend,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
