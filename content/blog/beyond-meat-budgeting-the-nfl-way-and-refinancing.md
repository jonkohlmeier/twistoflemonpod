Dear Listener,

Unfortunately, our meat alternative experiments aren't over yet. Stan bought and grilled up some Beyond Beef. He has a report for us this week. It sounds like Stan might try to try a beyond taco when he's in Atlanta.

Next up we talk Tacos. Beef choice, tortilla choice, cheese, and more. There is way to much talk of Taco Bell in this episode - our apologies to our taco purist friends.

This week Stan wrote a blog post about what we can learn about budgeting from the NFL. The NFL Players association released talking points on budgeting in preparation for an impending lockout. Overall, we think these things are really good advice for all people.

Jon's mortgage contact reached out to see if he was interested in refinancing. Does it make sense less than a year after he bought his house? Stan asks some inquisitive questions to arrive at a recommendation for Jon.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
