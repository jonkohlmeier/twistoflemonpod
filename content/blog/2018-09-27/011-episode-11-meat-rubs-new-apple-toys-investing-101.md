Dear Listener,

In this episode, Stan Lemon reviews Meat Rubs by Fenker (or.. Meat, Rubbed, and Salutary - branding pending.) Stan gives a good review but the only way to get them are to be friends with Rev. Aaron Fenker.

Stan got new Apple Gear, much of the world got new apple software, listen in for our discussion on that.

Milkshakes appeared, of course. You can hear a tale of two Five Guys milkshakes.

And to wrap it all up we get to what we planned to talk about. Investing 101. We talk saving strategies and basic investing.

If that doesn't give you a good idea of what life with a Twist of Lemon is... I don't know what will.

Thanks for sticking with us!
