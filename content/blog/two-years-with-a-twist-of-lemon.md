Dear Listener,

In episode 95 of Life with a Twist of Lemon we celebrate two years of doing the podcast by having Henry Lemon join. He talks about the new toy that appeared in their house that Stan alluded to last week.

Jon has a bone to pick with Aldi concerning a "seasonal" item that is in the wrong season. He also go another new toy for his yard.

Join us and celebrate two years. Share with someone who you think would enjoy another two years hanging out with us.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
