Dear Listener

This week we talk about Jon's life back in an office before jumping into our top halloween candy complete with a live taste test with a surprise guest!

From there we discus Form vs. Function as it applies to the MacBook and design in general.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
