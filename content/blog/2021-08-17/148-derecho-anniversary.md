Dear Listener,

This week we remember the devastating derecho that swept through Iowa last year on August 10. Jon gives an update on where repairs are at and some next steps forward.

We hear about Stan's vacation up to Michigan and all the fun that the Lemon family had and talk about Jon's upcoming visit to see Stan.

Finally we talk about a gourmet milkshake bar in Atlanta that was tweeted to us.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
