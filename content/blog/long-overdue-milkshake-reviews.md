Dear Listener,

Milkshakes return! Stan visited a gourmet Milkshake shop and Jon got a Shamrock shake. Stan gives Jon a hard time about not liking mint.

From there we have an update on our most used apps. Stan is still using most of the native Apple apps Reminders, Calendar, Notes, etc.

We also cover development tools, weather apps, and other notes of interest.

If you like what you hear please leave us a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
