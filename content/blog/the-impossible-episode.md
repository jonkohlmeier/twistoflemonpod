Dear Listener,

Happy 47th birthday to Jon's father-in-law, Rev. Mark Buetow!

Stan got notified about the Apple Card, he seems so excited about it that he thought Jon was too.

We did something impossible to our bodies in the past week. Both Stan and Jon made trips to Burger King Stan ate a Whopper and an Impossible Whopper. Jon just opted for the impossible whopper.

Listen in for our stories and experiences with the Impossible Whopper.

Stan spent a couple of days in St. Louis, while there they caught a Pirates game at Busch Stadium.

We also talk briefly about Stan's blog post on how he paid off his mortgage.

If you like what you hear or have other food challenges for us, let us know online or by leaving a 5-star review on iTunes.

Thanks for Listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
