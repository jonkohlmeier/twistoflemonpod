Dear Listener,

Stan has a lot of questions for the LWATOL resident Iowan following the fallout this week from the Caucuses. Now's your chance to get a nickel look into what exactly the Iowa caucuses are.

We briefly review Episode 2 of Picard. Not as great as episode one, but some bright spots.

Stan watched the Super Bowl, Jon did not. We talk about it anyway.. but mostly the food.

This week's life tip is Start Meetings on Time.

Stan has some great insights into Mastering Minimalism when it comes to paper.

Finally we talk about some new Facebook Privacy check features and the state of internet privacy.

Thanks for listening, leave a 5 star review on iTunes and tune in next week for the Pre-Lemon Disney Trip episode.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
