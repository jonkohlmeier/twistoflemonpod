Dear Listener,

We kick of this episode talking about iPhone and Apple Watch rumors and what we'd like to see from these new devices. One of those things is for Stan's battery issues to be solved

The Spiderman No Way Home trailer looks awesome. Listen in as we discuss that.

Finally Stan is headed back to school, so he gives us an update on the what, where, and why as we kick off the Fall term.

Thanks for listening

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
