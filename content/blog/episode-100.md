Dear Listener,

We celebrate our 100th episode today! We take a look back on 2 seasons of Life with a Twist of Lemon, It's been a weird year for everyone and it was no different for LWATOL.

To celebrate we talk food and apple two of the reasons we started the podcast to begin with.

Listen in and share with a friend.

Thanks for listening these last 100 episodes!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
