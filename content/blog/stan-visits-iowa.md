Dear Listener,

This week Stan and Jon are recording from the same room for the first time ever. Stan made it to Cedar Rapids for the weekend.

Stan talks about what we've done so far in Iowa including a trip to the Almost Famous Popcorn shop. Stan wasn't overly impressed with his Cookie dough Milkshake.

Spoilers for next week - we'll be taking a trip to the Hamburg Inn 02.

Stan also goes on a rant about "The Customer is always right."

Other Iowa adventures included Jon playing bartender for Stan, pork tenderloins, eating Mexican food, and a trip to Lowes.

We'll talk more about Stan's Iowa visit next week. Until then - stay sour!

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
