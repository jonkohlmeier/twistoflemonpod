![Stan with Milkshake Poptarts](images/stan-milkshake-poptarts-copy-768x1024.jpg)

Dear Listener,

Stan got a milkshake from Red Robin this week. It went about how you'd expect it to go. We also hit on some other things around Red Robin. We also discovered that there is a Strawberry Milkshake flavored Pop-Tart. Stay tuned for reviews of that.

Coming off of our sugar high, Stan tells us about his most recent iOS woes. He's running into trouble locking down screen time for his children's devices.

That leads into Adult Screen-time and what Stan has been trying to rush through so he doesn't have to pay for another month of Netflix.

Finally we each go through our Top 5 of 2018. Some items include buying houses, starting a podcast, and travel.

Thanks for listening in. We're still waiting for our first written iTunes review of 2019!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
