    <p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:00]</p>
<p>Dramas, please.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:13]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:20]</p>
<p>This is life</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:22]</p>
<p>with a twist of lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:25]</p>
<p>How's it going, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:27]</p>
<p>It is a Wednesday,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:30]</p>
<p>and it is going about as good as a Wednesday goes. Do have snow in Indianapolis</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:34]</p>
<p>as we have in here in Cedar Rapids?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:38]</p>
<p>We do not. However,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:40]</p>
<p>the rumor and the weather report</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:43]</p>
<p>would suggest that we will get some tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:46]</p>
<p>I am not gonna hold my breath. So it's saying let me see here. I think it says 21</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:52]</p>
<p>degrees</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:53]</p>
<p>is the low</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:55]</p>
<p>and we'll have snow.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:57]</p>
<p>So It's possible. Tomorrow Well, tomorrow Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:00]</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Halloween. Yeah. Definitely one. Yeah. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:03]</p>
<p>in theory,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:05]</p>
<p>kids running around the neighborhood</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:07]</p>
<p>will have snow.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:09]</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:10]</p>
<p>I remember trick or treating through snowstorms.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:13]</p>
<p>You don't do Halloween, do you, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:16]</p>
<p>I mean, describe don't do. We just it's inconvenient time, and we happen to not be at the house. We we like Halloween,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:24]</p>
<p>but Sarah's the organist and there's a church service, so that's where she's at. Got it. So do you look stock</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:32]</p>
<p>up on Reese's Pumpkins?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:35]</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:36]</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:37]</p>
<p>Mini snicker bars?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:40]</p>
<p>The last thing that this house needs is easy accessibility to snicker bars because that's that's a recipe for disaster for me. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:49]</p>
<p>that's that's my favorite candy, John. What's your favorite candy?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:52]</p>
<p>Might be Reese's peanut butter cups.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:56]</p>
<p>Okay. Do you are you a punch out the center kind of guy? No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:01]</p>
<p>Oh, interesting. You know what I'm talking about. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:04]</p>
<p>I know what you're talking about, but I haven't seen it done since like elementary school.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:10]</p>
<p>Well, you'll have to bring Reese's peanut butter cups with you next time you come to the Lemon House because we still do it that way. Alright. So Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:19]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:20]</p>
<p>we have some follow-up from last week's episode where you rip on our friends in Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:26]</p>
<p>Listener, Jason Toombs, who we've known for several years now,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:30]</p>
<p>commented on our Facebook page.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:32]</p>
<p>Dear lemon, there are plenty of other good people and things to do in Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:36]</p>
<p>If you want to follow</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:39]</p>
<p>if you want to follow vacation, I think we're missing a word there, you could have visited the world's largest ball of Cecil twine.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:46]</p>
<p>You could also have visited the geographic center of the Contiguous United States</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:51]</p>
<p>and the world's largest Czech egg.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:54]</p>
<p>Okay. So first clarification,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:57]</p>
<p>I did not at least I don't think I said that there were not good people in Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:02]</p>
<p>So I wanna I wanna put that out there. But I let me ask you this. Do you think he's serious</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:08]</p>
<p>or not</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:09]</p>
<p>in that post?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:10]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:12]</p>
<p>he used to live in Wyoming or something. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:15]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:16]</p>
<p>don't know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:18]</p>
<p>Yep. Yeah. That part of the country, it's it's a nebulous</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:22]</p>
<p>supposedly,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:23]</p>
<p>are lines that divide it up. So, you know, world's largest Czech egg</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:28]</p>
<p>probably ranks</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:29]</p>
<p>high coming from Montana. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:33]</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:35]</p>
<p>Because it's something, and it's a tourist destination.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:39]</p>
<p>Oh, okay. I I see where you're going. I see where you're going.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:43]</p>
<p>I So I think I think the bits I said that were offensive were that there's nothing in Kansas. Is that right? Correct.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:51]</p>
<p>Nothing to do I'm not backing I'm not backing down from that one.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:57]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:59]</p>
<p>have you heard my definition of like whether or not you live somewhere or you live nowhere?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:05]</p>
<p>I have not.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:07]</p>
<p>And this will be interesting because you grew up in a Chicago suburb</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:12]</p>
<p>and your wife grew up in what I would consider nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:18]</p>
<p>So Seymour is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:20]</p>
<p>not nowhere. Not nowhere. It is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:22]</p>
<p>a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:24]</p>
<p>destination along the way to nowhere. How's that? Alright. Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:29]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:31]</p>
<p>I my my rule of thumb is if it takes</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:34]</p>
<p>more than 10 miles to find a McDonald's,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:38]</p>
<p>you are officially</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:39]</p>
<p>in nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:41]</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:42]</p>
<p>So the the density of McDonald's across The United States</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:46]</p>
<p>is pretty high. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:48]</p>
<p>And if you</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:50]</p>
<p>like, if that's a trip into town</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:53]</p>
<p>or if that's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:54]</p>
<p>just a trip in general, maybe, let's say.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:58]</p>
<p>If if if you have to put effort into finding a McDonald's,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:02]</p>
<p>you live in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:04]</p>
<p>And that's alright. Like, some people like nowhere. I'm not I'm not trying to judge those that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:09]</p>
<p>want to live in the middle of nowhere. I'm just stating a fact that most of Kansas is nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:15]</p>
<p>Mhmm. I think I would agree with that. So thinking about here, I don't exactly know what my 10 mile radius is, but I think I probably have at least four McDonald's within 10 miles.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:27]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:28]</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I like, I'm in a similar boat. Right? In fact,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:34]</p>
<p>they they just built yet another McDonald's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:38]</p>
<p>close to me. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:40]</p>
<p>I don't know. But there are places inside of Kansas that count as</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:46]</p>
<p>somewhere. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:48]</p>
<p>But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:49]</p>
<p>in general,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:51]</p>
<p>Kansas is mostly nowhere. Sure. And that's okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:56]</p>
<p>That that doesn't</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:57]</p>
<p>disqualify the people from being good. In fact, it probably makes them better people if they aren't going to McDonald's regularly.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:05]</p>
<p>That's that's fair. They they at least at least have that on their side. But,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:09]</p>
<p>here's so I did do just not to, like, completely discount Kansas. I should highlight, I did some things.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:16]</p>
<p>They were arguably even touristy, though your mileage may vary. Yeah. One of those was I visited a presidential library.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:24]</p>
<p>We have a president who grew up in nowhere,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:28]</p>
<p>and he was an interesting president. He was also a a a general in</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:33]</p>
<p>World War two, a pretty important one. He's from nowhere, but he's a good person. At least seems like it. So I'm not trying to knock on the people from nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:42]</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:43]</p>
<p>Good people in nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:45]</p>
<p>In Kansas, Iowa, or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:48]</p>
<p>Did you have to look up what Cecil twine is, by the way? I did not.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:52]</p>
<p>I didn't invest that much time into my research.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:55]</p>
<p>So I here's here's what is unclear to me, and I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:00]</p>
<p>I I don't know. It's it's whatever. Like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:04]</p>
<p>the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:05]</p>
<p>to me, twine is twine. I don't know what is special about Cecil twine. So here's the thing. There's probably a largest ball of twine somewhere that's made out of different kind of yarn or twine,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:18]</p>
<p>and so this is their claim to fame, that this is a specific kind of twine.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:24]</p>
<p>Yeah. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:26]</p>
<p>the I I I think, again, like, it's really hard to say I'm not on on Facebook, I can't engage in this particular thread. But I think that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:34]</p>
<p>friend and listener of the show,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:38]</p>
<p>Reverend Toombs, is referring to the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:41]</p>
<p>ball of twine that exists in Cocker City, Kansas Yep. Which is the largest ball of Cecil twine built by a community</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:49]</p>
<p>according to Wikipedia,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:51]</p>
<p>which is different apparently than the largest ball of Cecil twine built by a single person. Interestingly enough Makes sense. They appear to be about 400 pounds different</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:01]</p>
<p>in weight.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:04]</p>
<p>I guess the the one built by a single person is actually taller.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:09]</p>
<p>I I don't know. This is a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:11]</p>
<p>I I'm looking at pictures of this, John, and I can't imagine</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:14]</p>
<p>I really can't imagine pulling off of the highway</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:18]</p>
<p>to stop and look at this.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:21]</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:22]</p>
<p>I have,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:23]</p>
<p>like, the world's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:25]</p>
<p>largest cast iron skillet,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:27]</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:28]</p>
<p>30 miles away,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:30]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:31]</p>
<p>I've not been there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:33]</p>
<p>And it is close to the bike path, so I may bike there one time. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:39]</p>
<p>I just I don't I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:42]</p>
<p>I don't know. Oh, got a nice little structure built around it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:46]</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Like it's apparently a big deal for what what I say, Corker City. Oh, no. The one I sent you was in Darwin Minnesota. Minnesota.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:53]</p>
<p>That's That's not even Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:55]</p>
<p>I I know. That's why I was calling out the difference between the one built by a community or the one built by an individual.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:01]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:04]</p>
<p>yeah. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:05]</p>
<p>a a check egg I what is a check egg? Do you know what a Czech egg is? I don't, and I really should considering there is a high density of Czech immigrants who settled in Cedar Rapids.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:16]</p>
<p>So we have, like, the Czech village and the Czech meat market, but don't know anything about eggs.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:23]</p>
<p>Here's the thing. If you search Google</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:26]</p>
<p>for Czech egg,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:28]</p>
<p>it's all about this place in Kansas. So Got it. I like, I I suspect that Czech eggs are probably something that existed before the world's largest Czech egg.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:38]</p>
<p>But again, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:40]</p>
<p>it's not not really selling it for me here. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:43]</p>
<p>you have not seen this, but our friend, Sandra Madden,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:47]</p>
<p>replied to his comment and said that the check egg is impressive.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:52]</p>
<p>Okay. So apparently, she stopped and seen the check egg. I think they did, like, a cross country trip driving stuff from conference to conference</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:01]</p>
<p>this last summer, so maybe they did it then. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:04]</p>
<p>Again, I want I want to understand the motivation</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:08]</p>
<p>for someone to say, I need to get off the expressway</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:11]</p>
<p>and look at the world's largest check egg. So I think that there are people who vacation</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:16]</p>
<p>by basically</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:17]</p>
<p>setting a route</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:19]</p>
<p>and driving</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:20]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:21]</p>
<p>deciding where to stop on a whim. This is not enough planning for Stan's vacations, and you wanna know that you're gonna have food at the times that you wanna have food.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:32]</p>
<p>I I still I just don't</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:35]</p>
<p>I don't know, Stan. I I I don't understand. I think that you need to work on creating the largest lemon</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:41]</p>
<p>in Indianapolis.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:44]</p>
<p>I am the largest lemon in Indianapolis.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:49]</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:50]</p>
<p>Put a sign out in your fine yard.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:53]</p>
<p>My, I will say when we were driving to Kansas, my son was exceptionally disappointed to learn that Kansas City is not necessarily in Kansas. No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:02]</p>
<p>So this was earth shattering to him. For his whole life, short as it is, he told me he believed that the Kansas City Royals played in Kansas and that the Kansas City Chiefs played in Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:15]</p>
<p>And I had to explain to him that there's actually a Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:19]</p>
<p>And and he said that made no sense.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:22]</p>
<p>He asked Kansas City, Kansas. Yeah. No. No. He's definitely not wrong.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:27]</p>
<p>But then he asked, like, is there Kansas to Kansas? I'm like, yeah. It's right across the river. And he's like, well, is it is it bigger than Kansas City, Missouri? I'm like, no. No. No. It's it's very small. It's very small comparatively.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:39]</p>
<p>And so then then he wanted to know why they don't call them the the Missouri Royals</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:44]</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:45]</p>
<p>the Missouri Chiefs. And I I don't have a good answer. I I don't.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:50]</p>
<p>I know that once I got past Kansas City, Kansas, it was a long time before I saw McDonald's. That's all I know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:11:58]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:00]</p>
<p>Anything else on Kansas or world's largest things? I'm just</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:04]</p>
<p>just because we're on a roll here. I am I apologize</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:08]</p>
<p>to anyone that I have offended</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:10]</p>
<p>in describing the place where you live as nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:14]</p>
<p>Somebody has to live in nowhere, you should be proud of it. It is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:19]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:21]</p>
<p>Alright. Another Facebook comment follow-up from last week from Steve Bricker who is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:26]</p>
<p>lives in</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:28]</p>
<p>Cedar Rapids. I have not met him. Like, I think we were on the same email list once, but he lives here. He likes beer.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:37]</p>
<p>He's a Lutheran, and that's what I know about Steve Bricker. But he said, I was thinking that once the Cedar Rapids bunker is complete, if ever, and it is. I'm sitting in it right now. Air Lemmage, come to town for a bunker warming party. You can invite all of your listeners from Eastern Iowa,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:54]</p>
<p>both of us.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:56]</p>
<p>I I think he just wants to hang out with you, John. Could be.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:00]</p>
<p>And you Is this You're the one who was supposed to come.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:05]</p>
<p>I I'm not I I don't know how to like, having seen the pictures of this room,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:10]</p>
<p>I I don't think I'm gonna put on 400 miles just to see it in person. No offense, John. No. That's fair. It's nothing special. Maybe once I get my map of Middle Earth hanging on the wall,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:20]</p>
<p>that might make it worth it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:22]</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:23]</p>
<p>Alright. I'm also not sure I can handle the orange wall.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:26]</p>
<p>I like my orange wall.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:28]</p>
<p>I'm I'm glad you do, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:32]</p>
<p>Alright. I do think that we have at least three listeners in Eastern Iowa if Steve is in fact a regular listener.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:39]</p>
<p>Well, thank you, Steve, for tuning in. We appreciate your listenership.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:43]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:45]</p>
<p>Life tip. You have a complicated history with roundabouts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:49]</p>
<p>There was a very, very long time where you did not like roundabouts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:53]</p>
<p>Now last time we talked about it, I think you started to like roundabouts in certain situations,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:58]</p>
<p>and now you have a life tip about. That's life.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:00]</p>
<p>Yeah. Alright. So continuing our segment segment of life tip with lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:05]</p>
<p>Theme music. Here's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:07]</p>
<p>here's the, here's the general gist.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:10]</p>
<p>Don't stop.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:11]</p>
<p>It's not a stop sign. It's a yield sign. You might not know what a yield sign looks like because you don't see them very often, but they do not mean complete come to a complete stop. If you're coming to a complete stop, all you're doing is upsetting somebody else somewhere in the roundabout.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:25]</p>
<p>So you're you're right. I've got complicated history.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:29]</p>
<p>I think the first legitimate roundabout I encountered was in Pittsburgh somewhere. They were not popular</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:35]</p>
<p>there, but I I do I think it was probably up in Cranberry Township.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:40]</p>
<p>And I I just I was left with this empty feeling like, why is this here? This didn't help my day.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:45]</p>
<p>Then I moved to to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:48]</p>
<p>to find out that apparently they're very popular in Indiana. And the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:52]</p>
<p>folks of Carmel, Indiana have placed them everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:56]</p>
<p>Why Carmel, Indiana loves their roundabouts, I do not know. But I thought to myself, that's Northern Indianapolis.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:03]</p>
<p>I live in Southern Indianapolis.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:05]</p>
<p>What's the likelihood that, you know, they will infiltrate my people? Famous last words.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:10]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:11]</p>
<p>So we have like, the part of Indianapolis I live in used to be a bunch of, like, farms. Right? So it's farm country. It's just, you know, narrow country roads,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:22]</p>
<p>but the population has increased significantly down here. And so you get to rush hour,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:28]</p>
<p>everybody comes to a stop sign,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:31]</p>
<p>they take too long because nobody knows that the person on the right goes first, whatever. You know, you just you roll with it. Right? Sure. And it takes forever to, like, drain out these intersections. So over the summer, they thought, well, you know what? Traffic's bad. Why don't we make it worse by just tearing out all these intersections at once and replacing them with roundabouts?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:49]</p>
<p>And I think the problem is that if you have not been driving through a roundabout,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:54]</p>
<p>you like, you're predestined to be an idiot at a roundabout. Right? Like, it's I I do do you remember in driver's ed anybody telling you about a roundabout?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:04]</p>
<p>I do not. And I don't think there were any roundabouts</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:07]</p>
<p>in the Milwaukee area when I took driver's ed.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:10]</p>
<p>Yeah. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:12]</p>
<p>the roundabout is,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:14]</p>
<p>I think, potentially a beautiful concept in that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:17]</p>
<p>you're not supposed to come to a stop, and you're supposed to allow traffic to move</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:22]</p>
<p>without having to have a light or stop signs. Like, it's it's a regulation</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:28]</p>
<p>or or like, it regulates traffic flow</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:31]</p>
<p>without having everything come to a halt. Now you gotta slow down. Sure. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:35]</p>
<p>Can't can't just like, you know, Danica Patrick get right through the middle and over the top, like she said on some recent</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:41]</p>
<p>episode of Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:43]</p>
<p>She apparently doesn't like roundabouts, so she just steamrolls over the middle. I don't I don't know that actually works. Yeah. Maybe she drives a jeep, but whatever. It's fine.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:52]</p>
<p>So so there's I think the thing that's driving me nuts is people who pull up to this roundabout, and they're like, oh, there's somebody coming the opposite side. They haven't reached the roundabout yet. I gotta stop for them. No. You don't have to stop for You keep driving. Yep. And in fact, if you have stopped and have waited long enough that another car has entered the roundabout that was not there at the point at which you've arrived,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:14]</p>
<p>you have waited too long. Sure. You have stopped too long.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:17]</p>
<p>The goal is to keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:21]</p>
<p>There is one exception to this rule.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:25]</p>
<p>If you're going to hit a car? Or a pedestrian.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:29]</p>
<p>Okay. I what pedestrian decides to cross</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:34]</p>
<p>in the middle of a roundabout? They wouldn't cross in the middle. They would cross at an entry point of a roundabout.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:41]</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:42]</p>
<p>Alright. You're gonna have to find me a roundabout that people actually walk around. I will be in Nashville a couple weeks from now, and I will take a picture. Oh, yes. Well, I'll I'll do a video of me crossing the roundabout.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:56]</p>
<p>Alright. Well, this I this I look forward to. You you're here's the thing though. You'll be the only person all week that does sides to cross that roundabout on foot. So around Monument Circle, does that count as a roundabout?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:08]</p>
<p>Or are there stop signs at the entry points?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:11]</p>
<p>There there I don't believe there are stop signs. The Monument Circle is is odd because it is so much bigger. Sure. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:19]</p>
<p>it's a touristy thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:22]</p>
<p>So there's, like, there's other stuff going on. But I I will say this,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:27]</p>
<p>it's still pretty frustrating to come to a complete stop trying to get onto Monument Circle. Like, that Yep. That's also not an acceptable place, I think, to just, like, put it in park, which is, I think, essentially what people do.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:39]</p>
<p>I I don't know what it is. I get stuck behind people at these roundabouts, and I lose my mind.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:44]</p>
<p>And I'm, like, I'm yelling at them from the car, rolling the window down.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:48]</p>
<p>There is no stop sign. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:52]</p>
<p>Well, that too.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:54]</p>
<p>But I so anyhow, the life tip with lemon is don't stop at a roundabout. That's not what it's there for. The roundabout is so that you can keep moving. So just go. Okay? If if you don't think that you should go, you're thinking wrong. I like it. There's just no way around it. The purpose</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:10]</p>
<p>is to continue in a forward motion.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:13]</p>
<p>Also, here's just like a bonus life tip with Lemon. Don't turn left.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:17]</p>
<p>Good grief.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:20]</p>
<p>If you get an accident</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:22]</p>
<p>due to the advice of life with Twisted Lemon, please don't hold us responsible and sue us. Yeah. We're not liable for stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:30]</p>
<p>It'd be it'd be like that one random listener who's like, oh, Lemon said don't stop at the roundabout. There was a car in front of me, so I drove into it. It's like, no. That's that's not what I meant at all.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:40]</p>
<p>I think that the trick is you can't be on your cell phone. Right? You gotta be paying attention as you approach a roundabout, because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:47]</p>
<p>you're gonna slow your speed enough to allow anybody that is going to intersect with you to move first.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:53]</p>
<p>And then the goal is to pull in right behind them.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:57]</p>
<p>Now, I will say,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:58]</p>
<p>some people are complete idiots and decide to like see what top speed they can hit going into a roundabout, which makes it impossible for other traffic to flow in the roundabout. So going too fast is almost as bad as stopping,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:10]</p>
<p>but like just don't stop at a roundabout. That's that's all. Alright. Good life tip from the lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:17]</p>
<p>We'll see what you come up with next week.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:20]</p>
<p>Speaking of life tips, so apparently,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:23]</p>
<p>my father-in-law beat us to the whole tracking car maintenance in a note.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:28]</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, you surprised? No. He's he's pretty obsessive about his note taking apps.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:34]</p>
<p>Yeah. I think the only, like, truly miraculous thing is that they're all in the same note app that he uses for everything else. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:41]</p>
<p>And that he hasn't lost them in the process of migrating from Note app to Note app. So so for the for the listener that doesn't know Mark Vito,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:48]</p>
<p>there</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:50]</p>
<p>was a period of time he's he's all in on Bear, which is a a Notes app for iPhone, iPad, and and Mac.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:57]</p>
<p>But for a while there, he was literally on a different Notes app every seventy two hours.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:03]</p>
<p>At least.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:04]</p>
<p>Yeah. Sometimes multiple at once.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:07]</p>
<p>Reason the App Store is profitable is because of Marc Buto. Like, he is he's possibly single handedly propped up notes apps that had no business ever being in the App Store in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:17]</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:18]</p>
<p>But Mark Buto likes to support developers.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:22]</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey. No. No. I'm not knocking on that. Like, at least that part. It's it's just amazing, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:28]</p>
<p>you know, I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:30]</p>
<p>just I mentioned Mark, like, searching for notes,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:33]</p>
<p>right, in the App Store, scrolling, like, oh, I don't have that one yet. I'm a pick it up. There you go, Stan. Write a note app.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:40]</p>
<p>Make it like Yeah. Give Mark the hey,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:43]</p>
<p>Mark. Use a $99 note app. It'll change your life.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:49]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:51]</p>
<p>Mastering minimalism, we've been on a minimalist kick the last couple weeks. I threw out a bunch of stuff, cleaned my desk,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:58]</p>
<p>got rid of things.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:00]</p>
<p>You started reading the book of</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:03]</p>
<p>what's the name of the book? Tidying Up?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:07]</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:09]</p>
<p>I can't remember now. Yeah. It's it's the first Marie Kondo And then you Tidying Up. You gave up reading that book because it did not spark joy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:17]</p>
<p>No. It did not. And the narrator like actually put out joy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:22]</p>
<p>Snuffed it out. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:25]</p>
<p>Opposite of joy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:27]</p>
<p>So mastering minimalism this week topic is the wallet.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:32]</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:33]</p>
<p>you don't actually have a wallet anymore. Do you, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:36]</p>
<p>Well, I guess it comes down to what do you define as a wallet.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:40]</p>
<p>Have you seen my wallet?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:42]</p>
<p>I've had this You have a big Yeah. You have a big old fat leather one, don't you? That I've had for like fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:47]</p>
<p>Okay. So first of all, props to you. I'm impressed that it held up that long. You must have invested in some high quality leather back in the day. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:56]</p>
<p>I think it was a Christmas gift. Do</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:58]</p>
<p>you have cash in that wallet? I do not carry cash ever.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:02]</p>
<p>Okay. So Broke Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:04]</p>
<p>Broke. What makes your wallet</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:06]</p>
<p>as big as it is?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:10]</p>
<p>I don't know. It's the width of my finger.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:14]</p>
<p>So I have a bunch of different cards.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:17]</p>
<p>Probably don't need them all.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:19]</p>
<p>See? Here we go. Alright. We'll do this right now, Stan. You talk. I'll go through and see what I can get rid of.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:25]</p>
<p>Okay. So first of all, I think most people have multiple credit cards, but they don't use all of them. Sure. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:33]</p>
<p>And yet they Are you saying I need get rid of those?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:36]</p>
<p>No. I'm not saying that, like, look, there is value in having specialized cards, but I think those specialized cards wind up not needing to be in your pocket all the time. So I'll give you just an example for me. I don't use my Discover card regularly at all, so I don't carry it. I don't use my work card except when I travel for work, so I don't carry it. Right? That's a good idea. I carry I carry a single credit card. I carry a debit card. Those are the only two</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:03]</p>
<p>pieces of, like, financial transaction swiping</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:06]</p>
<p>that I carry. Interesting. How many cards do you carry, John?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:10]</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:12]</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:14]</p>
<p>When was the last time you used all four in a week?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:17]</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:18]</p>
<p>Okay. Alright. So part of the problem is I don't have a secure place to keep my work credit card at work, which is where I use it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:27]</p>
<p>Not that me carrying it in my pocket is secure, but Okay. Hold on. Let's let's let's let's dig into this a bit. When you use it at work,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:35]</p>
<p>are you actually showing the plastic?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:38]</p>
<p>Are you punching into a website?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:40]</p>
<p>I punched into a website.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:42]</p>
<p>So it should be in one password. You're right, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:46]</p>
<p>Yeah. See, so if there's if you have a security issue at your office, which is a little concerning, but whatever,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:51]</p>
<p>then</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:52]</p>
<p>Well, like you should I just left it out of my desk.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:56]</p>
<p>That would make you an idiot. That's Sure. That's the security problem. That's just like total brain fart. Don't you have a a drawer with maybe a lock? No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:04]</p>
<p>I do not. What? Well, that that's a problem.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:08]</p>
<p>If if you exist in a shared space and you don't have a lockable drawer,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:12]</p>
<p>you can't trust anybody. Alright. I don't trust Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:17]</p>
<p>You have you have your So work card to go on one path? Password. I have my state ID,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:22]</p>
<p>which is a real ID. Alright. Unlike Kentucky, who's, like, anti real ID or something like that, so everybody needs a passport to fly.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:30]</p>
<p>Oh, interesting. I didn't know that. Alright. So What do you have left after you've separated out your cards, your credit cards, and your ID? I have an insurance card.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:40]</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:43]</p>
<p>Because I would lose it otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:46]</p>
<p>What do you need your insurance card for? When I go to the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:50]</p>
<p>Do you? You need it every time? They actually look for a copy of it? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:55]</p>
<p>I mean, I go to a doctor once a year, so my insurance probably changes once a year too, but, you know. You you know what I do? What? I I have that in my iPhone</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:03]</p>
<p>wallet app.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:05]</p>
<p>See, I don't really use my wallet app.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:08]</p>
<p>Well, maybe that's part of the problem. So that's something that I don't</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:11]</p>
<p>I don't use and I can consolidate. So I also have my prescription card there. I have my triple a membership card there. I have my Starbucks card, and I have a bunch of different points cards, and they're all there gunking that up rather than my pocket. So What about a library card, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:27]</p>
<p>That I do have. That I carry on me. K. And the reason I carry that on me is because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:33]</p>
<p>thus far they have not produced an Indianapolis Library</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:39]</p>
<p>entry for the the Wallet app. Sure. As soon as they do, I will not carry this anymore. What do you feel about like those key chain ones? Do you have any, like, key chain, like, fuel savers? I don't do that. K. No. Alright. So do you always drive drive the same car? I do.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:54]</p>
<p>Yeah. See, that's that's not my world. So my keys hang by the the door to the garage, and I grab the pair of keys that I need for the car that I am departing with.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:04]</p>
<p>And I guess you never really carry, like, house keys or anything because you can enter through the garage.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:10]</p>
<p>That that's true. There I mean, there's a house key that hangs up there as well Sure. But,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:14]</p>
<p>you know, like, I no. I'm not I'm not gonna take that with the other thing is I've got a keypad on my garage door.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:20]</p>
<p>So you can get in even if your thing dies.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:23]</p>
<p>Yeah. Well power's out? If the power's out, then you're then you're done for, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:28]</p>
<p>Yeah. That's true. That's true.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:30]</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:31]</p>
<p>if the power's out for an extended period of time, I'd figure something out. But I I have a keypad actually on the garage door and then the door in the garage to the house, if that makes sense. Got it. So Sure. That one's actually powered off battery.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:45]</p>
<p>A lot of garage door openers have a battery backup now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:48]</p>
<p>You know, teach his own. But so I carry my library card. I wish Indianapolis library didn't make me do that. I have a secondary ID for being a Casa that I carry, and then there's only one thing left in my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:01]</p>
<p>So I have a Hilton Hilton Honors</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:05]</p>
<p>membership card, which I believe is also in my wallet app, so I don't need that one either. So I'll take that out. Yeah. And how how often do you stay at a Hilton hotel? Every time I stay at a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:14]</p>
<p>Okay. But, like, are we talking about five times a year? At most. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:19]</p>
<p>Okay. So why don't you just remember to pull up furthermore, here's another bit with at least that rewards card in particular.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:27]</p>
<p>When you make your reservation, which I'm assuming you make in advance Yep. You're gonna plug that in. It's gonna be in one pass. And then they're already ready to greet me.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:35]</p>
<p>And Yeah. You don't you do not need the physical plastic for that at all. I just took it out, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:40]</p>
<p>Oh,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:41]</p>
<p>more things,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:43]</p>
<p>couple of business cards,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:45]</p>
<p>and my voters' registration card.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:49]</p>
<p>Okay. How often do you vote, John?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:53]</p>
<p>I don't know. Well, we'll see if I go vote next week for school board elections and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:59]</p>
<p>We we have a mayoral election this</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:01]</p>
<p>isn't even a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:04]</p>
<p>this isn't even</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:06]</p>
<p>a legit card.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:08]</p>
<p>See, again, take it out, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:10]</p>
<p>I should shred that, actually.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:14]</p>
<p>Alright. What else we got, John? That's it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:16]</p>
<p>Alright. That's as bad as I thought. You're you're still supporting all four credit cards? I am.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:22]</p>
<p>I could probably go down to two.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:26]</p>
<p>I mean, I have one credit card and two debit cards.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:30]</p>
<p>Two debit cards? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:33]</p>
<p>Why? Because I have one connected to Ally and one for my local bank, which is basically where I all my money goes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:42]</p>
<p>Sounds like you need some more consolidation on your banking front, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:47]</p>
<p>Possibly. I'm not ready to give up a local bank yet though.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:51]</p>
<p>Why not? What do you is it you do at a local bank that you you need to do? I just like being able to have</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:57]</p>
<p>the ability, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:00]</p>
<p>Okay, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:01]</p>
<p>I don't have a good answer. It's just I'm The next I'm old fashioned and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:06]</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:08]</p>
<p>The next time you're in the bank and you're dealing with a grumpy teller, just ask yourself, is this person sparking me joy right now? I have never had a grumpy teller at my local credit union.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:18]</p>
<p>Well, then you are truly a unicorn, my friend. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:21]</p>
<p>I used to get quarters all the time, but now I have my own washer and dryer. So Last last thing in my wallet is a Wileypalooza</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:29]</p>
<p>stamp card.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:30]</p>
<p>So every time I get ice cream, I stamp it. I used to have a popcorn shop</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:34]</p>
<p>punch card, but they just went to, like, this they got this tablet thing for a loyalty</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:40]</p>
<p>members thing, and you just check-in by touching the screen when you check out. So I don't have that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:45]</p>
<p>See, I would love that. I would love that. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:48]</p>
<p>I have other loyalty cards, but they're all digitized. Right? So Jimmy John's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:53]</p>
<p>Jimmy John's has a loyalty program?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:56]</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:58]</p>
<p>They're called Freaky Fast Rewards.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:00]</p>
<p>Got it. So I've got the Marcus Theater app,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:05]</p>
<p>which tracks all my stuff, especially if I order tickets through there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:09]</p>
<p>Oh, there you go. So you're you're on the path to wallet minimalism. Yeah. What do you mean? But here's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:14]</p>
<p>I need to update my wallet to one of those fancy clip things.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:19]</p>
<p>I I tell you what, man. I seriously love mine. So what I found is when I traveled, I would put my wallet in my front pocket Yep. Because it's more secure. Like, I hop on the public transit, whatever. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:31]</p>
<p>And the bulkier wallet like you have just wasn't working for me. So missus Lemon got me a Fidelio.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:39]</p>
<p>Or excuse me, Fidelo, not Fidelio.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:41]</p>
<p>And I'm a big fan. It's it's small, fits in my front pocket. I don't carry it on me all the time either though. I actually leave it in a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:49]</p>
<p>container on my desk and I grab it when I have to leave the house. So unfortunately,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:54]</p>
<p>I have to leave the house much more frequently than you do because I commute to work via my car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:59]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:32:02]</p>
<p>yeah, there's that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:04]</p>
<p>Yep. There's that. So, alright. Just real quick to summarize. I would recommend you have a debit card and a credit card. If you are using more</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:12]</p>
<p>than one in the course of a week, you probably have created yourself a pretty confusing financial system, so you should look at that anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:19]</p>
<p>You should digitize as many of your rewards cards as possible,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:32:23]</p>
<p>like the Hilton card that John was carrying. I took it out. I also took out my Hy Vee Fuel Saver card.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:30]</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah. You probably enter an ID in there, don't you? Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:33]</p>
<p>Yeah. See?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:35]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:36]</p>
<p>then, you know, stuff like your triple a membership or your health insurance card, etcetera. A lot of those things, honestly, they'll fit into whatever if you're using Android,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:46]</p>
<p>you know, whatever, good luck to you. But on the iPhone, you can stick them in the Wallet app, and then you have everything.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:53]</p>
<p>And the nice thing about them being in the Wallet app is I don't have to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:57]</p>
<p>remember to swap them out or to update them when they renew, and that's pretty cool. That is pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:06]</p>
<p>I just sent you a link to the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:09]</p>
<p>wallet that I've had on my Amazon wish list for</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:13]</p>
<p>probably over a year now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:16]</p>
<p>This is nice. This still to me looks like it's too But big</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:19]</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:21]</p>
<p>But I if you're one that carries cash, I could see this making a lot of sense. I do not carry cash though.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:26]</p>
<p>I don't carry cash and I don't plan to, so I'm I'm cool with what I got. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:32]</p>
<p>So on that note, John Alright. I think we covered a lot of ground. It is the last game of the world series tonight. I know. I might tune in.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:41]</p>
<p>Oh, look at you.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:43]</p>
<p>Made it out to seventh seventh game.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:46]</p>
<p>Last night's game was fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:48]</p>
<p>I did watch video highlights of the last night's game.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:51]</p>
<p>My son stayed up till midnight to watch the whole thing. I promised him that during an elimination game, he could stay up and watch it. And I did not think I really did not think we'd get to this point in the series. I didn't think there'd be a game six, but Sure.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:07]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:07]</p>
<p>last Do you think night's game was something because of the the the blown call,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:12]</p>
<p>and then Martinez getting ejected.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:14]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:16]</p>
<p>So do you think that the home team will be able to pull off a win tonight for the first time in the whole series?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:23]</p>
<p>I don't know, man. Six road wins. It's it like defies</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:27]</p>
<p>defies expectations. During the world series.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:30]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:32]</p>
<p>Home field like, what's I think what's fascinating is home field advantage hasn't mattered. Yep. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:39]</p>
<p>teams playing with the designated hitter or not have also not mattered. Like, the the Nationals bats were hot with the DH. They're not used to DH. The Stroz bats were hot without the DH, and they're not used to pitchers pit get batting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:53]</p>
<p>Sure. So I think that there's enough inter league inter league play</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:58]</p>
<p>that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:59]</p>
<p>it probably doesn't matter as much as it used to.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:03]</p>
<p>Maybe. I mean, it's a different game strategy. I don't know that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:06]</p>
<p>American League teams play enough</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:10]</p>
<p>national league teams to really</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:13]</p>
<p>perfect the strategy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:15]</p>
<p>I mean, if you just think, like Sure. Division games. Right? Like, the the national league, it just plays differently. There's there's no way around it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:23]</p>
<p>But I don't know. So by the time this airs, Series will have been determined. Yeah. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:29]</p>
<p>I'm I'm still hoping it's the Nationals. I'm really enjoying</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:32]</p>
<p>You know? That team, that story. I will not be unhappy</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:35:36]</p>
<p>no matter who wins. It's just nice to have two</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:35:40]</p>
<p>decent teams, but I would lean towards the National League nationals.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:45]</p>
<p>Yep. Well and, you know, I think I they just have so many great stories going on. Yeah. I think the Astros,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:52]</p>
<p>fine team, solid baseball team.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:56]</p>
<p>I I just I think their story</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:59]</p>
<p>is a little less interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:01]</p>
<p>That's fair.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:02]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:36:03]</p>
