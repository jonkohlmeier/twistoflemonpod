    <p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we finally talk Euchre! Turns out Stan doesn't know how to play.</p>
<p>Jon's boss is out of the office this week, so Jon's in charge! That leads into us talking about opening our own e-commerce store complete with lemonade glasses. Stan doesn't like the idea of a tornado shaped lemonade glass.</p>
<p>Jon went to Five Guys and did not have a great experience. The burger cooks didn't value craftsmanship as much as we do here at Life with a Twist of Lemon.</p>
<p>Because our dear friend Crysten did not understand any of the Star Trek banter, this week we decide to talk about resumes.</p>
<p>Stan talks about some to dos and not dos for what to include on a resume. Where his resume has been and what the current format is.</p>
<p>This turns into one of those practical advice episodes that everyone likes so much. So stick through the early part of the episode to hear the Lemon drop some wisdom.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
