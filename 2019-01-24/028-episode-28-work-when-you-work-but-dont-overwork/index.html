    <p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today's episode kicks off with some follow-up by Stan on what he found to track his time when on his laptop. It seems promising so far.</p>
<p>The rest of the episode was sparked by a tweak about advice to new software Developers. Stan replied: &quot;Time management. Work when you work, but don’t over work. When I was new I kept absurdly long days, sometimes worked on the weekend and was always connected by email. I’m a better engineer now that I manage time boundaries for myself.&quot;</p>
<p>This leads into what exactly he means and concrete takeaways from what we've learned through our career paths and some mistakes we've made along the way.</p>
<p>This episode feels a little different than some of our other ones. Mostly because Jon was really interested in learning everything he can from Stan.</p>
<p>Listen in, let us know what you think!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
