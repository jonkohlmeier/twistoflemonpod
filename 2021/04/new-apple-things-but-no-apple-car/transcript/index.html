    <p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:00]</p>
<p>Dramas, please.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:13]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:20]</p>
<p>This is life</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:22]</p>
<p>with a twist of lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:24]</p>
<p>Well, hey, John. Hi, Stan. How's it going? It's going well.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:28]</p>
<p>So listeners don't know this, but you and I haven't actually talked this way to record an episode</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:34]</p>
<p>in almost three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:37]</p>
<p>That's true. Because we recorded on some weekend randomly, and we recorded two episodes back to back. We did. We did. And apparently,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:46]</p>
<p>they were decent enough that nobody noticed, but here we are. Well, I don't know. We missed some vital information</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:52]</p>
<p>that we're a week late on. So We didn't miss it. We just we queued it up. Yeah. So you're listening to Life With a Twist of Lemon. I am Stan Lemon. This is?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:03]</p>
<p>John Colmire. I was gonna say Life With a Twist of Lemon, but,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:08]</p>
<p>we're a little rusty today. That's okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:11]</p>
<p>You can find us on the world wide web at <a href="http://twistoflemonpod.com">twistoflemonpod.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:16]</p>
<p>And of course, we're on your favorite social media network,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:19]</p>
<p>whether that be Facebook adamable. Or Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:22]</p>
<p>We're not yet on Instagram,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:24]</p>
<p>but the pressure is mounting. I have an idea, Stan. Oh, boy. How familiar are you with TikTok?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:32]</p>
<p>I know what TikTok is, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:34]</p>
<p>Have you seen, like, the random TikTok dances that people do?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:39]</p>
<p>No. Think we should do one of those.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:43]</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:44]</p>
<p>Alright. Well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:47]</p>
<p>I I that seems like such a bad idea. Those videos are transient.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:51]</p>
<p>Right? They disappear after a time?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:53]</p>
<p>I don't know if TikTok does that or not. Snapchat is the one that deletes things after you send them.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:59]</p>
<p>Well, deletes sort of deletes things. Yeah. But sure. I mean, stores it for their own monetary purposes. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:05]</p>
<p>Okay. Well, we'll</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:07]</p>
<p>let's take that under advisement.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:10]</p>
<p>Yeah. We can we can possibly do something there. Oy. Alright. So how how have you going? I think the how have you been going? How have you been going? How have been doing? Wanted to check-in on</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:20]</p>
<p>lawn. I'm I'm a hot mess today to be completely honest with you.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:25]</p>
<p>My lawn? That's not on the list.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:28]</p>
<p>It's not, but I feel like it's totally fair game because we have not had a lawn update from John Kolmeyer in a while and we know how particular you are about your grass.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:36]</p>
<p>Well, I'm trying to get my grass to a state of perfection and it's not working out so well.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:42]</p>
<p>So I've mowed several times at this point, four maybe.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:47]</p>
<p>I edged</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:48]</p>
<p>and trimmed last weekend.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:51]</p>
<p>I sprayed weeds</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:54]</p>
<p>a week ago from today, so last Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:56]</p>
<p>The weeds are dying,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:58]</p>
<p>but we are in desperate need of rain. And I'm already seeing some discoloration</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:03]</p>
<p>from</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:05]</p>
<p>my grass checking out because it wants water.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:08]</p>
<p>Oh, no. Know? I don't really wanna run a sprinkler in April here.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:13]</p>
<p>It's just so weird that you have not had</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:16]</p>
<p>any I mean, it like, you've had such little rain that you're now seeing stress on the lawn. I I would not expect that in April. Yeah. Especially in</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:26]</p>
<p>a historically farming state where they really rely on precipitation early in the year.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:31]</p>
<p>Yeah. Well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:33]</p>
<p>with with you, if it's not an Eldorado, apparently, it's a a drought. Which we dealt with last year too, so hopefully it's not a repeat of last year.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:42]</p>
<p>I am happy to report that the grass is green, very green. My daughter has mowed,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:48]</p>
<p>I think, three times now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:50]</p>
<p>I have edged. I have weed whacked.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:52]</p>
<p>I have not sprayed</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:54]</p>
<p>for weeds yet,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:57]</p>
<p>mostly due to laziness.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:58]</p>
<p>I have what I believe are three dying trees in the backyard that I'm not totally sure what to do with. So so that that's an imminent problem that I'm facing. But, the grass itself looks good. I will say the things you prescribed worked out fine.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:13]</p>
<p>The the was it prodiamine?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:16]</p>
<p>The</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:17]</p>
<p>Yep. The thing that kills crabgrass. Yeah. Stops crabgrass from germinating.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:21]</p>
<p>That did not have my spreader listed on it, and so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:25]</p>
<p>that was a little not great. Have a Scott's rotary spreader?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:29]</p>
<p>I do. It wasn't listed on it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:32]</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:33]</p>
<p>Yeah. You have to check it out. Called me up.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:35]</p>
<p>Well, I think I texted you, and it was a Saturday morning, I believe. So you were doing whatever it is you're doing Saturday morning without your phone. So That's fair.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:44]</p>
<p>Suffice to say, that that is what it is what it is. But yeah. Good deal. So I wanted to follow-up on last week's episode. We talked about spring cleaning, and as I was editing, it hit me. Do the lemons use lemon scented cleaning products?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:58]</p>
<p>No. No? I mean,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:00]</p>
<p>if if there's lemons naturally present I'll give you an example. Right? There is an</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:05]</p>
<p>antibacterial spray that Mrs. Lemon uses, like, to clean the table outside.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:10]</p>
<p>That part of the it's, like, all natural or whatever. It has, like, lemon</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:15]</p>
<p>stuff going on in it, so that smells lemony. But in the house,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:19]</p>
<p>there are not cleaning supplies that are used which have lemon scents. Actually, in fact,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:25]</p>
<p>everything is scent free inside the lemon house, including</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:29]</p>
<p>laundry detergent,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:31]</p>
<p>and we don't use the little dryer towelette things either. There you go. I am</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:37]</p>
<p>definitely for that when it comes to laundry products</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:40]</p>
<p>because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:41]</p>
<p>you and your daughter Evelyn,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:44]</p>
<p>your clothes probably shouldn't smell the same scent.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:48]</p>
<p>That would be weird, wouldn't it? Yeah. So I don't know. I like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:53]</p>
<p>if</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:54]</p>
<p>everything</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:55]</p>
<p>has a smell to it, and so if there is an opportunity to not have a smell in something that is coming into contact with your body, I'm all for it. So as an example, right, the gel I use in my hair has a distinct smell, same with my,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:07]</p>
<p>deodorant. And to have those in conflict or combating</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:12]</p>
<p>my,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:13]</p>
<p>you know, clothing smell, think, just be a little too much for me. So Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:17]</p>
<p>So I'm a big fan of using lemon oil on</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:22]</p>
<p>wood furniture.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:24]</p>
<p>Kind of rehydrate the wood and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:28]</p>
<p>does takes care of dusting at the same time. But that's the only lemon product that I think we have. K. I mean, I endorse lemon flavored things all the time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:39]</p>
<p>Lemon scented</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:40]</p>
<p>fine, just not in cleaning products. I don't know. I like, I want cleaning products to clean, and then I want to forget that they exist. I don't want to think about potentially</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:49]</p>
<p>harmful chemicals residing wherever I'm making contact. Maybe I'm too paranoid, but that's that's where where my brain's at. Alright. Fair enough. That's enough spring cleaning for this year. Yeah. I'm done with that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:04]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:06]</p>
<p>our regular listener, Katie,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:10]</p>
<p>I guess it was a couple weeks ago now where I asked for episodes ideas,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:14]</p>
<p>and she's heard us talk a lot about lawns and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:19]</p>
<p>houses and things like that, but we haven't talked a lot about vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:25]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:26]</p>
<p>I guess we can talk about vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:31]</p>
<p>Neither you nor I like to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:33]</p>
<p>purchase vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:35]</p>
<p>No. I really don't. And in fact, I would say this. I I I've said this before. This is not a new thing. I would rather buy a house</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:42]</p>
<p>than I would buy a car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:45]</p>
<p>I I just I don't I don't know what it is. I I find car dealerships</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:50]</p>
<p>painful.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:51]</p>
<p>I find the process of purchasing</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:55]</p>
<p>a vehicle,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:57]</p>
<p>to be way longer than it needs to be.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:01]</p>
<p>I don't know. I, like, I I truly hate the process of buying a car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:06]</p>
<p>Now that said,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:08]</p>
<p>I do also recognize that there are two kinds of people in this world.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:12]</p>
<p>Those who love their cars for the fact that they're a a beautiful piece of engineering, they enjoy driving,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:18]</p>
<p>the luxury of it, like all that. And then there are the utilitarians of this world, and I am firmly in the latter camp.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:25]</p>
<p>I long and desire to be in the former, but I'm I'm just not. I'm not. As much as I would love to, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:31]</p>
<p>geek out about my car and have a really nice expensive one and drive it wherever I want and and break the speed limit all the time, the fact of the matter is Kinda do that last one normally, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:42]</p>
<p>Not like, I break it a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:48]</p>
<p>Sorry, dad.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:50]</p>
<p>You taught me to drive well. I I just also learned from mom too. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:55]</p>
<p>so the reality is I I wanna be that person. I I just don't think I'll ever be that person until my kids are out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:03]</p>
<p>It's not how it's just not the priority I put on how I spend my money by and large. I mean, now, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:10]</p>
<p>let me level. Right now, I have two eight year old cars.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:13]</p>
<p>Yep. They they're both twenty thirteens. One is a minivan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:17]</p>
<p>The other is an Accord.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:19]</p>
<p>They're both Hondas.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:20]</p>
<p>The the minivan was bought brand new,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:24]</p>
<p>and the Accord was bought gently used.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:27]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:28]</p>
<p>am not opposed to buying a new car. I'm not opposed to buying a used car. I think it comes down to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:34]</p>
<p>dollars and cents and how expensive</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:37]</p>
<p>the potential miles are on the used side of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:41]</p>
<p>Yeah. So the Lemons and the Kohlmeyer's are both firmly in the Honda camp.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:47]</p>
<p>Mine is mostly because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:49]</p>
<p>of money.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:50]</p>
<p>Like, initial I've we both of ours are</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:54]</p>
<p>used cars that we bought, 2013</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:56]</p>
<p>Civic and a 2014</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:58]</p>
<p>CRV.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:59]</p>
<p>So both my cars are pretty old too, but I have a knack of finding</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:04]</p>
<p>relatively</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:06]</p>
<p>middle ranged old used cars with, like, 30,000 miles on them. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:13]</p>
<p>Yeah. Your your your skill set there is is very particular and one I wish I had because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:20]</p>
<p>the cars you've gotten, you've gotten pretty good deals on too. Like, I mean, just in again, in terms of the cost of those miles, that's the thing that I look at. Right? And and so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:29]</p>
<p>just to frame this, when we bought the minivan, one of the reasons we bought it new was because it was nearly impossible</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:35]</p>
<p>to find a used</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:38]</p>
<p>Honda</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:39]</p>
<p>Odyssey in Pittsburgh</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:41]</p>
<p>with, like, less than 60,000 miles on it. And and that 60,000</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:45]</p>
<p>miles was only costing me, like, 5 to $7.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:49]</p>
<p>Right? Which is a lot of money. Don't get me wrong. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:52]</p>
<p>a minivan is expensive, and those were really expensive miles.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:56]</p>
<p>Right? And so I just kinda made this calculation,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:59]</p>
<p>at the time</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:01]</p>
<p>on the expense of those miles and whether or not I thought it was it was worth it to to just buy new, and that's why I ultimately</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:07]</p>
<p>did that, plus they had the color I liked.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:11]</p>
<p>With the Accord,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:13]</p>
<p>the the amount of mileage that was on that vehicle and the discount that I got for it was, like, orders of magnitude less expensive, right, like, in terms of, like, per mile,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:23]</p>
<p>and and so that's that's why we went with that one when we did. Now I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:27]</p>
<p>love that Honda Odyssey. It</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:30]</p>
<p>is a really fantastic car. There are some times that I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:33]</p>
<p>long for one with</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:35]</p>
<p>Apple CarPlay,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:37]</p>
<p>but that's not enough to make me upgrade the car. The Accord,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:41]</p>
<p>I don't really care for. Like, it's it's there. It's it's a fine car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:45]</p>
<p>It it I would prefer, like, leather trim and some other things going on, but it's it's a functional vehicle that gets me from point a to point b,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:54]</p>
<p>and it has very little mileage and will probably last us a very long time. I would expect it to be Lucy's first car,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:00]</p>
<p>maybe Henry's first car too.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:02]</p>
<p>Yep. But, you know, we'll see. I maybe this is an interesting thing to to to touch on. All three of your vehicles have been Hondas. Correct? Correct.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:11]</p>
<p>Have you ever owned anything other than a Honda? I have not. So, I mean,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:16]</p>
<p>my parents</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:17]</p>
<p>now drive Toyota, but, like, I learned to drive in some Dodge minivan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:26]</p>
<p>Oh, what was it? It was like a Chevy Aveo I drove around in for a while, hatchback.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:31]</p>
<p>I think I showed up I showed up in Grand Rapids once with that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:36]</p>
<p>But yeah. So my first car,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:39]</p>
<p>I had a class that was at a different college campus up in Mequon, which is a thirty minute drive from Milwaukee.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:45]</p>
<p>And I had been taking the city bus to all my other classes, which were in the same city I lived in.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:51]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:52]</p>
<p>when I signed up for that class at the different campus, then I bought my first car on eBay,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:59]</p>
<p>a local auction there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:01]</p>
<p>My dad and I went over to check it out. It was a 2003</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:06]</p>
<p>Honda Civic coupe manual everything,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:10]</p>
<p>transmission</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:11]</p>
<p>locks,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:12]</p>
<p>windows,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:14]</p>
<p>no air conditioning. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:18]</p>
<p>I hey, man. Like, you that was it was the right car for that moment in time. I I love that car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:24]</p>
<p>I know you did. I know you did.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:28]</p>
<p>It was tricked out in a weird way too, but, you know, it it is what it is. So I didn't start as a Honda,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:35]</p>
<p>fanboy. I would I would</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:38]</p>
<p>probably classify myself</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:39]</p>
<p>as that now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:41]</p>
<p>But what happened was</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:44]</p>
<p>to to back up some,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:46]</p>
<p>my grandfather</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:48]</p>
<p>was a white collar worker for Chrysler</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:51]</p>
<p>all the way up into the early eighties, and then he retired.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:55]</p>
<p>We always had a family discount for Chrysler products. So, you know, we had Dodges and Plymouths and and Chrysler cars, and what happened was I just had it infused in my brain that I was always gonna drive a Chrysler car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:07]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:08]</p>
<p>my first vehicle was a Dodge Neon that I bought from my parents,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:14]</p>
<p>and it it largely drove just fine. It wore</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:19]</p>
<p>hard in Pittsburgh because Pittsburgh roads are not great.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:23]</p>
<p>Yeah. That was constant experience.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:25]</p>
<p>So shortly after I bought this stick shift car that I just learned how to drive, I took a trip out to Pittsburgh to come visit you,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:32]</p>
<p>and those hills are nothing to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:34]</p>
<p>mess with. Yeah. They're they're they're beasts. Right? Cincinnati kind of compares, maybe a little bit, but not not as much.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:44]</p>
<p>So so the the car wore hard. The first car that I bought, not from my parents, was a was a Chrysler Sebring</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:52]</p>
<p>Sedan,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:52]</p>
<p>not not the convertible.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:54]</p>
<p>And that those cars, they were fine. They just had a very high</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:59]</p>
<p>service cost to them. The third car I bought was a Dodge Durango, and this was, like, right around the time</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:06]</p>
<p>that we were going into like, as a country into recession</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:10]</p>
<p>in the in the late, we we say late aughts. Isn't that how you say it? Late two thousand aughts? Sure.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:17]</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:18]</p>
<p>I love that I love that truck. It's what I I always call it a truck. I loved it. It it was tricked out to the nines, had every bell and whistle that Chrysler could put on it, and I paid almost nothing</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:29]</p>
<p>for the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:31]</p>
<p>But the maintenance of that vehicle was awful. Like, it was just unbelievably</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:36]</p>
<p>bad,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:37]</p>
<p>and it got terrible gas mileage. And once I started commuting into the city, I needed to make a change,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:43]</p>
<p>and so I traded in the Durango for a Honda Civic hybrid.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:48]</p>
<p>And I did this</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:50]</p>
<p>by and large because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:52]</p>
<p>I wanted good gas mileage for what was an insanely long drive in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:58]</p>
<p>But I I also I didn't want</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:01]</p>
<p>the the, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:03]</p>
<p>stereotype or the stigma around a Prius at the time,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:07]</p>
<p>and I wanted something that was low maintenance. Right? And and every every everything that I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:13]</p>
<p>read told me that from a customer satisfaction standpoint, from a maintenance standpoint, Honda was a good brand. And anecdotally, I could back that up. Right? I had I had a cousin who drove a Honda literally until the body fell off, like there was not enough duct tape to keep the body on, and the car just kept going.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:30]</p>
<p>So I I took a gamble, and I bought a brand new Honda Civic hybrid, and that car was fantastic. I put an insane amount of miles on it, probably to the tune of about 35,000 miles a year. Wow. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:43]</p>
<p>I had no maintenance costs at all. I like, none. I we I changed the oil,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:49]</p>
<p>and I got an alignment. Right? And that was it. Now, in Pittsburgh, you get an alignment probably every six months. Just do it because you don't have a choice, but but beyond that, there were no costs. And so it was such a stark contrast to my experience with the three prior Chrysler company cars. And and,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:06]</p>
<p>you know, in Chrysler's defense, it was a low point for them from a a manufacturing standpoint</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:11]</p>
<p>that I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:13]</p>
<p>I was sold. I was hooked. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:15]</p>
<p>when it became apparent that we needed a larger vehicle for a larger family,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:21]</p>
<p>we traded in that Civic Hybrid for a Honda Odyssey.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:25]</p>
<p>And that that vehicle</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:28]</p>
<p>was just a really wonderful</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:30]</p>
<p>ride.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:32]</p>
<p>It was it was a great family car. It kinda, like, broke my stigma around having a minivan,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:38]</p>
<p>which I was opposed to. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:40]</p>
<p>And then there were no main again, no maintenance costs. Like like, this thing</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:46]</p>
<p>has been the least expensive vehicle I have ever owned, that Odyssey.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:50]</p>
<p>The Accord is is a is a close second. I just haven't owned it as long, so I'm sure it'll beat it. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:56]</p>
<p>for me, between the Civic and the Odyssey,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:59]</p>
<p>that kinda sealed the deal. Right? Like, I I found a trustworthy,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:04]</p>
<p>reliable brand</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:05]</p>
<p>that I'm now willing to stand by. Kind of the same way that I view Apple, to be totally honest with you. Like, I just have had good results, and so when you have good results, you you tend to repeat them, and I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:15]</p>
<p>this is just my personality. I have a very high sense of brand loyalty. When I find something I like, I stick with it. You know?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:23]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:24]</p>
<p>So I remember that Durango and you obsessed over keeping it clean</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:29]</p>
<p>both inside I and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:32]</p>
<p>I washed it every week. Every week.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:35]</p>
<p>And it was a white car too, wasn't it? It was. It was. Yeah. I I kept it immaculate.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:41]</p>
<p>I I loved I loved that vehicle. I loved how it felt to ride in it to be that high off the ground. It was great.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:49]</p>
<p>It just was a stupid expensive car. I mean, it really was. Everything that could go wrong went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:56]</p>
<p>Everything that I had go wrong on the previous two cars combined, that also went wrong on that on that car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:01]</p>
<p>It it just</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:03]</p>
<p>wasn't a good ride. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:05]</p>
<p>Well, I've had good luck with my Civics.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:08]</p>
<p>My</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:09]</p>
<p>first car, I did a bunch of crazy stuff too.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:14]</p>
<p>Like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:15]</p>
<p>we broke off a bolt when we were changing the caliper, like a caliper bolt. We broke off,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:22]</p>
<p>so we had to rethread it. So there was one on there that was threaded the right way instead of reverse threaded like everything else.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:29]</p>
<p>Oh, jeez.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:32]</p>
<p>What else did I do to that car? I don't know. It had modified</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:36]</p>
<p>cool air intake, so that was always fun.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:39]</p>
<p>Things like that. You did all of your own maintenance on that, didn't you? I did. I learned how to change oil on that car,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:45]</p>
<p>change brake pads.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:49]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:50]</p>
<p>Yeah. Eventually, I had to get the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:54]</p>
<p>what was it?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:56]</p>
<p>There was some relatively big expense around the suspension system or something like that, but</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:02]</p>
<p>that's it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:04]</p>
<p>I have not gone to that level</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:07]</p>
<p>in terms of maintenance. I've done a lot of my own maintenance over the years. On the Odyssey and the Accord, up until the pandemic, I I really I always took it in for an oil change in the dealership and and just did that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:18]</p>
<p>because I've also had a really good experience at the Honda dealership.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:22]</p>
<p>So the used car I bought was a Honda certified.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:25]</p>
<p>That proved to be</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:27]</p>
<p>a solid thing. I mean,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:29]</p>
<p>again, just haven't had issues.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:31]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:33]</p>
<p>I I will say this.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:35]</p>
<p>I as I mentioned, I long for the day when I can buy an impractical car.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:41]</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:42]</p>
<p>And for you, that's not a Tesla like it would be for me. No. No. No. No. No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:47]</p>
<p>I I have always</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:50]</p>
<p>loved Mercedes Benz. I I just I love their cars. When I was</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:56]</p>
<p>first learning how to drive,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:59]</p>
<p>I would drive to the Mercedes Benz dealer and just sit in cars.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:03]</p>
<p>I I that's what I did. Seventeen year old, you know, just walking into a dealership</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:08]</p>
<p>and talking about like, I would joke. I'd say, oh, yeah. Well, dad asked which one I I want, and so do you happen to have this in, you know, whatever color? It's totally making an upright because my dad was a high school math teacher. Like, we're we were buying a Mercedes Benz.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:20]</p>
<p>But someday I long for</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:23]</p>
<p>probably, like, a CLS coupe is kinda what I want. I want a coupe, not a sedan because I don't I don't want doors to invite children into it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:33]</p>
<p>But maybe in my my heart of hearts, want an s class, but that's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:38]</p>
<p>I I don't know. I'd I'd go to jail driving an s class. So That's what would come down to. There are a lot of our friends who think that we're very similar.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:45]</p>
<p>This is a very stark way in which we are different. I have absolutely no desire</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:50]</p>
<p>to own</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:52]</p>
<p>a fancy car outside of the Tesla because it's cool technology.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:56]</p>
<p>Like Yeah. A Corvette, I'd love to drive one. No desire to own one. So Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:03]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:04]</p>
<p>for me, the thing I want is a big, gaudy,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:09]</p>
<p>luxury</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:10]</p>
<p>car. Right? Not like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:12]</p>
<p>you know, an s class is kinda in that that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:15]</p>
<p>sort of inching towards Roadster</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:19]</p>
<p>automobile,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:21]</p>
<p>and that would be that would be fun. But I I really just want a big gaudy luxury car</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:26]</p>
<p>someday,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:27]</p>
<p>not anytime soon. When I do it, I probably won't buy it outright. I'll probably lease that one for a variety of reasons that we can save for another future episode.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:37]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:38]</p>
<p>So that's cars maintenance wise.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:41]</p>
<p>So ever since I moved to an apartment, I pretty much have someone else change my oil. I do change the air filters because people like to charge you an insane amount to change a</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:50]</p>
<p>$6 air filter.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:52]</p>
<p>So They really do. And that it's for the most part really easy, you know. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:59]</p>
<p>good deal. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:01]</p>
<p>Kinda shifting gears here. Did you</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:04]</p>
<p>catch the Apple releases? The ones that people were worried we didn't record about previously.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:09]</p>
<p>So I forgot that there was something going on, and then all of a sudden, like, the Apple newsroom notifications started popping up on my desktop.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:18]</p>
<p>I'm like, oh.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:21]</p>
<p>So there were like six that came through.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:24]</p>
<p>So, alright. Are you caught up to speed now though? I am. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:29]</p>
<p>I wrote down the highlights. I think for me, there were four big product releases. They're probably smaller. Oh, actually, there's another one. Forgot. Five.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:37]</p>
<p>I'll start with I think what I think is is probably the most benign for most people, which was the Apple Card having joint</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:44]</p>
<p>account ownership.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:46]</p>
<p>Did you catch this? I did not. Alright. So this has been one of my complaints. My wife has an Apple Card. I have an Apple Car Apple Card. They're separate accounts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:54]</p>
<p>Apple is going to change that. They're going to unify or allow you to do a joint account for a family,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:59]</p>
<p>but they're gonna maintain individualized</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:02]</p>
<p>lines of credit for each user.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:04]</p>
<p>So so missus Lemon and myself will have our own line of credit. It'll impact our credit score. You know, we'll get the benefits of that credit</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:11]</p>
<p>where you don't necessarily get with a joint credit card. So I thought that was kinda cool. I honestly, I think this was a little over due. I don't know how they thought they were gonna do this without joint accounts in the first place, but to each his own.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:25]</p>
<p>That was a quick one though. I think the the star of this show was</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:31]</p>
<p>the iMac, but but the second star I would say would be the AirTags,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:35]</p>
<p>which Yeah. So AirTags,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:37]</p>
<p>they've been talking about for years.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:38]</p>
<p>Rumors. Well, they haven't been talking about. They haven't. Pundits have been talking about. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:42]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:43]</p>
<p>nice that those finally dropped.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:46]</p>
<p>I guess nice. Like, I don't I didn't buy any,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:50]</p>
<p>and I don't know what I would use them for if I did.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:54]</p>
<p>Well, this is the thing I've been struggling with because I want so badly to have a use case for one, and I have not been able to come up with it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:03]</p>
<p>So I I did go ahead and buy one. I didn't buy the four pack like I planned to originally, but I bought one.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:09]</p>
<p>And I'm not totally certain what I'm gonna do. They might go on my Crocs. They might go on the dog leash. They might actually go on the dog. I haven't I I really haven't decided.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:17]</p>
<p>But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:18]</p>
<p>I think this is really interesting technology.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:21]</p>
<p>You probably seen or heard of Tile before. Tile is a a similar, like, small tracking device that uses,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:27]</p>
<p>low power Bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:30]</p>
<p>It's deceptive to think of this like Tile</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:33]</p>
<p>because this takes the whole idea of tracking something to a totally new level because it uses an ultra wideband,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:40]</p>
<p>antenna that is involved in the the device in your iPhone. Like, this is how the Find stuff works.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:46]</p>
<p>And and what's fascinating about it is it doesn't just rely on your device</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:50]</p>
<p>to track a thing. It actually revolve relies</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:53]</p>
<p>on the whole network</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:55]</p>
<p>of devices that are attached to Find My using this ultra wideband antenna.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:59]</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:00]</p>
<p>if you truly lose something and you are out of Bluetooth range, it is actually still possible to find</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:06]</p>
<p>one of these devices, whether it's an AirTag or your phone or whatever using the Find My app.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:10]</p>
<p>And so, like, it generally takes it up to the next notch. There's a whole bunch of privacy and security concerns Yeah. That come with that. How, like, a bunch of dystopian science fiction films start?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:21]</p>
<p>It probably could be. Yeah. Well, I think one of the one of the legitimate concerns are is, like, I could take this AirTag and drop it into so and so's book bag,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:30]</p>
<p>right, and track where they go. Now Apple has done some, I think, really interesting privacy stuff on that front to avoid that use case. Right? And to, like, notify somebody that an AirTag is nearby and and things of that sort.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:43]</p>
<p>It remains to be seen in what like, how effective that is and in what ways this could be abused.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:49]</p>
<p>That said, I think this is another instance of Apple taking technology that was already out there, right, like Tile, and really taking it up to the next next level. You know?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:00]</p>
<p>Something I'm not sure that they took to the next level is the Apple TV.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:05]</p>
<p>Now, you have an ancient Apple TV. Right? Yeah. And I haven't turned it on for who knows how long though.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:12]</p>
<p>And I think it's it's not anybody's surprise</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:16]</p>
<p>to hear that I don't really like the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:19]</p>
<p>the Apple TV. I've I've got and I shouldn't say it that way. Really, what I hate is I hate the remote, and I hate the experience of interacting with it. But in terms of, like, the interface and what it does, I think it's it's fine. Right? Like, most everybody else has copied the Apple TV OS experience for the most part.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:37]</p>
<p>There's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:38]</p>
<p>a totally brand new remote on this one. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:41]</p>
<p>beyond that, I would say the key feature is this has HDMI 2.1,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:46]</p>
<p>and it's gonna support fifth 60 frames per second at four k. So basically, all of the, like, whiz bang new technology for four k comes in this Apple TV. Previous Apple TV supported four k.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:58]</p>
<p>It's honestly gotten better with the latest software update, but by and large, this is just improving the capabilities of the device to support</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:08]</p>
<p>even better pictures.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:11]</p>
<p>I'm I'm gonna order one because I have two four k TVs and only one four k Apple TV, plus I want the new remote. I think what remains to be seen is if I will order a second remote</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:22]</p>
<p>for the second TV. I will also say this this product is still too stinking expensive</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:28]</p>
<p>for</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:29]</p>
<p>what it does.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:31]</p>
<p>I I think I think Apple would make an argument that if you use Fitness plus,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:36]</p>
<p>if you use it for gaming,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:38]</p>
<p>it's actually really affordable.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:40]</p>
<p>That might be true, but I'm not convinced that that warrants what we get out of this.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:47]</p>
<p>Yeah. So maybe with the way, like, games are going,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:51]</p>
<p>but I haven't had any experience with arcade.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:54]</p>
<p>But what</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:56]</p>
<p>I can't figure out is why I would buy an Apple TV at this point for the Kohlmeyer household</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:03]</p>
<p>when I really love the Roku experience</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:06]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:07]</p>
<p>Roku is built into my main TV. So it's not like I need another device for it. Yep. Yep. I think</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:14]</p>
<p>so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:16]</p>
<p>from a pure hardware standpoint,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:19]</p>
<p>it's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:21]</p>
<p>again, I'm just not sure this is really competitive. I I do think on the operating system standpoint, especially for</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:26]</p>
<p>TVs that don't support Dolby Atmos,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:29]</p>
<p>from a from a visual standpoint or, like, HDR.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:32]</p>
<p>With some of the things that they're doing in t v o s I'm I'm jumping the gun here to the announcements that just came out or just released this week. But but some of things that calibrate image, there's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:42]</p>
<p>Apple's doing Apple stuff to make your existing crappy TV</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:46]</p>
<p>look great on Apple TV.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:48]</p>
<p>Right. Excuse me. Making your existing TV look great on Apple TV. Right? And I I do think, for most people who have a crappy TV that's not configured properly,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:57]</p>
<p>that could level up their viewing experience.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:00]</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:01]</p>
<p>if your TV doesn't stink, if you have kind of these image standards which are already,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:06]</p>
<p>again, standardized,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:08]</p>
<p>you're you're probably not really gonna gain much from the visual standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:13]</p>
<p>I've I've said a million times, I think Apple Arcade is one of the best things that Apple's done in in recent memory. I I I'm a big fan. Even even if I don't use it a lot, I'm I'm a big fan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:23]</p>
<p>I did hook up my Xbox x controller</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:27]</p>
<p>to my Apple TV after the latest Apple TV OS update</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:31]</p>
<p>just to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:33]</p>
<p>It was fine.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:35]</p>
<p>I would say the the lag latency there is pretty painful,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:39]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:40]</p>
<p>the range doesn't seem to be great. Maybe that'll be better with the new Apple TV. I don't know. I will report back when I get at when I get one.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:50]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:51]</p>
<p>Alright. So so far, three Apple announcements that I have no interest in taking a look at.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:58]</p>
<p>Yeah. Well alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:01]</p>
<p>There was a new iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:04]</p>
<p>Yep. And and the iPad Pro is not the computer for most people, first of all. Right? I I think, by and large,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:12]</p>
<p>this was interesting because they took the processor, the m one processor that Apple put into its Max</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:19]</p>
<p>at the tail end of last year into their iPad.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:22]</p>
<p>And so now the the lines of, like, what makes these systems amazing</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:27]</p>
<p>have been blurred even more. Yep. Right? So I I love my m one Mac. I I it is easily one of the best computers I've ever purchased.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:35]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:37]</p>
<p>have zero reservations</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:39]</p>
<p>on on on buying it. The only like, the only thing I'm upset about, truth be told, is that I waited as long as I did.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:45]</p>
<p>So so bringing that kind of power into the iPad, I think, is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:49]</p>
<p>IPadOS has to keep up with this device now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:53]</p>
<p>Yep. Right? That's the challenge, and I'm not sure</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:56]</p>
<p>that Apple is pushing iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:58]</p>
<p>fast enough, hard enough to go there. Some app developers are, but Apple itself isn't.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:05]</p>
<p>I I still love the iPad. I think most people should have an iPad instead of a computer. I just think they should have the base model.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:12]</p>
<p>Now, the 12.9 inch model has an interesting mini LED screen.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:18]</p>
<p>The</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:19]</p>
<p>reason I love my iPad Pro, which is several years old now, is because the quality of the screen is so much better. And and I think it's one of these things where once you get a better screen, it's so hard to go back.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:30]</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:31]</p>
<p>And so that's why I haven't I haven't upgraded</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:34]</p>
<p>to a new iPad Pro because they're stupid expensive,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:37]</p>
<p>I and haven't upgraded to, like, an iPad Air because the screens still aren't there yet.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:42]</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:44]</p>
<p>So I'm I'm stuck. I'm in a weird position. If they I will tell you this. If they had come out with those mini LED</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:49]</p>
<p>if the that mini LED screen</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:51]</p>
<p>on the smaller</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:53]</p>
<p>and let me be clear. It's the HDR screen really that I'm I'm I'm all</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:57]</p>
<p>geeking out about, which is the same thing that Apple's doing in their monitor.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:01]</p>
<p>If they had done that in the the 10 inch model, I would have already bought one. I mean, when they they come out a couple days, you know what I mean? Right. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:10]</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:11]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:12]</p>
<p>I don't know. Depending on the day,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:15]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:17]</p>
<p>think that I wanna buy an iPad,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:33:20]</p>
<p>but it would not be an iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:23]</p>
<p>I I just don't think most people need a Pro. I this device in my mind is really targeted to a very</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:32]</p>
<p>niche group of users, of of like legitimate power users because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:36]</p>
<p>they're not do they're not like</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:38]</p>
<p>the processing power of the m one in the iPad Pro is for powering a set of creative apps that people are gonna use in the field that most people just don't buy. Right? Right. And and having the, like, reference screen quality of the iPad Pro</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:53]</p>
<p>is gonna be lost on most people, especially those that are, like, you know, dropping it and tossing it and doing all the things that that we do with our iPads because they're pretty resilient little devices.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:03]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:04]</p>
<p>I don't know. Really cool tech. Like, Apple's continuing to to push the envelope</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:09]</p>
<p>and do things that I didn't even see coming. Right? And so that I I get excited about that. But again, like, not not a product that I need just yet. Give me give me HDR over on</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:21]</p>
<p>the not HDR, XDR. I keep saying that wrong. Ugh. Daniel Sanchez is screaming at the at his iPhone. Yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:31]</p>
<p>Did that in the 10 inch model though, and and I'm I'm there. I'll buy one.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:36]</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:37]</p>
<p>last,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:38]</p>
<p>but certainly not least,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:40]</p>
<p>was the m one iMac.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:42]</p>
<p>And this to me was the most interesting</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:45]</p>
<p>thing out of the whole</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:47]</p>
<p>the whole show that they put on, the hour long release</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:51]</p>
<p>show.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:52]</p>
<p>What what did you make of this?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:54]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:56]</p>
<p>I don't know. It's weird because, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:35:00]</p>
<p>who is the customer for the iMac now?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:04]</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I I think this is a general purpose desktop computer. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:09]</p>
<p>I think the the fact of the matter is that this is probably still the most affordable,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:14]</p>
<p>best quality screen</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:16]</p>
<p>that you can get. Yep. And and the fact that there's a Mac that's literally strapped to the bottom of it</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:22]</p>
<p>is really nice. It's really convenient.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:24]</p>
<p>And the fact that that Mac is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:28]</p>
<p>probably more powerful than any other consumer grade computer you can get right now,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:35]</p>
<p>is just an added benefit.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:36]</p>
<p>So so for me, it's it's it's kinda like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:39]</p>
<p>do I need one of these? Absolutely not. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:42]</p>
<p>If I had two desks,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:45]</p>
<p>one for my office and one for my work, I would probably buy one of these because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:35:49]</p>
<p>they they just seem like the go to answer to a desktop computer. And I people still use desktop computer. Right? Like, if and and if they don't, they probably have an external monitor. And, again, this is the best monitor that you're gonna get and put on your desk short of buying Apple's full XDR screen at, you know, what is it, $5,000 a screen? Crazy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:09]</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:11]</p>
<p>There's a lot of really interesting tech in terms of sound quality and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:16]</p>
<p>the microphone quality.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:17]</p>
<p>They were really excited about their</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:22]</p>
<p>camera, but it's still just ten eighty p. I mean, give me a freaking break.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:26]</p>
<p>I'm I'm so glad that it works in low light, but give me a four k camera, you know, on on a on a device of this quality. I think I think that's overdue.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:36:36]</p>
<p>I love the colors. I absolutely love the colors. So, like, that's the big thing because I mean the iMac has looked</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:36:43]</p>
<p>pretty much the same. I mean, there's been minor differences for a long time now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:36:48]</p>
<p>And I think this is a nice new look. It looks like something somebody at a marketing agency is gonna wanna fill the office with,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:36:56]</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:36:57]</p>
<p>If they ever go back to the office. Right? Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:02]</p>
<p>Yeah. No. I agree. And and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:04]</p>
<p>the thing that struck me though is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:06]</p>
<p>on the front, the device is mostly just glass.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:10]</p>
<p>It's the back that's gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:12]</p>
<p>Yep. And the back of my monitor faces a wall, you know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:18]</p>
<p>So if I bought it just because it looked absolutely gorgeous, I don't know that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:22]</p>
<p>that would be the right reason for my my workspace. I'd have to find it. I'd probably turn my desk around just so everybody walking by could see it. There you go. But you you need a need an iMac on like the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:37:33]</p>
<p>bar by the kitchen sink.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:35]</p>
<p>Yeah. I told you. Missus Lennon, if you're listening, John thinks I need one too.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:41]</p>
<p>What color would you go with, Stan? Oh, we had this discussion as a family. Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:37:46]</p>
<p>My inclination is probably yellow.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:37:48]</p>
<p>That's what I'm thinking for you. Yeah. Yeah. Lucy wants an orange but I I really like the look of the orange.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:37:55]</p>
<p>I also like kind of the green and blue.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:37:58]</p>
<p>I'll look really slick.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:38:00]</p>
<p>The gray is boring.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:02]</p>
<p>The gray is boring. Their actual colors, like, honestly, all the colors they did look fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:07]</p>
<p>Yeah. There's not a bad there's not a bad choice there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:38:10]</p>
<p>Red is bold, but I suppose people are looking for a bold red color. It is bold. It is bold. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:16]</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, I almost forgot about the iPhone 12.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:21]</p>
<p>Did you catch the the lilac colored iPhone 12? I did.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:25]</p>
<p>I was so mad. If they had done this as an iPhone 12 pro,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:30]</p>
<p>I would have already ordered one. Like Yep. I that's that's my favorite color. In fact, I wanna redo the podcast logo and I wanna use the color of that iPhone</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:39]</p>
<p>to do it. That's what I think we should do. It's it's gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:38:43]</p>
<p>Hey. Our</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:38:44]</p>
<p>friend and listener, Joe Taylor, is an art teacher. How is he at graphic design?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:49]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:38:50]</p>
<p>I know that he can superimpose his face on a variety of Marvel characters. So maybe he's one to talk to about a new logo. Can there?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:38:59]</p>
<p>I just hear lilac color.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:02]</p>
<p>There we go. Alright, Joe. There's a challenge for you and your class.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:39:06]</p>
<p>Can give you all the all the old old stickers that we haven't given away yet.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:12]</p>
<p>I you know, if he had a a budding art student figure out a way to come up with a classy logo that we could leverage, I think we could make it worth their while. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:21]</p>
<p>Alright. So it was the Apple release. I think it was interesting. I but again, I am not convinced that most of these products</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:28]</p>
<p>are for the general population. Right? Or John. Don't think yeah. Or John. I don't think most people are gonna buy an Apple TV.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:36]</p>
<p>I don't think most people need an iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:39]</p>
<p>I don't think that the iMac is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:42]</p>
<p>especially widespread in terms of a need. I I do think if you want a desktop computer though, this is the one to buy. Hands down, no questions asked. Unless you've been waiting play video games. There you go. And if you've been waiting, pull the trigger. Now's the time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:56]</p>
<p>AirTags,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:39:57]</p>
<p>I just am not convinced that this is a wide net,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:00]</p>
<p>but but we'll see. I I I'll report back if I get to try mine.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:04]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:06]</p>
<p>Alright. And then this week was</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:10]</p>
<p>Apple OS releases.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:11]</p>
<p>Yep. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:13]</p>
<p>have been waiting with suspense for iOS 14.5</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:17]</p>
<p>for a long time. I came dangerously close to installing the betas several times on this one for what I think is the headline feature,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:26]</p>
<p>which is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:27]</p>
<p>emojis with beards.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:40:29]</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:40:30]</p>
<p>Did you do you feel like you're now represented in the emoji space?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:40:36]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:40:37]</p>
<p>I don't really use emojis</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:40:40]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:40:41]</p>
<p>most of the time I don't understand what the emoji is trying to say. So there's one with like a teardrop coming out of the forehead that Anna always likes to use and I have no idea what it means.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:40:53]</p>
<p>Have you have you tried have you tried googling for it? I did, and then it wasn't overly helpful. So I don't know. I don't understand emojis.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:41:00]</p>
<p>It's probably because I'm now old and boring.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:41:03]</p>
<p>And who needs to use emojis</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:06]</p>
<p>when the Memoji is such a thing now? Well, okay. I think that's a fair point. The Memoji is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:12]</p>
<p>is like a great great thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:14]</p>
<p>To be clear, what John is referring to is the grinning face with sweat emoji.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:20]</p>
<p>And according</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:21]</p>
<p>to Emojipedia,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:23]</p>
<p>it has the same grinning eyes as the grinning face with smiling eyes, but with a single blue bead of sweat usually over its left eye. Intended</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:32]</p>
<p>to depict</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:34]</p>
<p>nerves or discomfort,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:36]</p>
<p>but commonly used to express a close call as if saying, phew,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:40]</p>
<p>and wiping sweat from the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:42]</p>
<p>So there you go, John. I've given your your explanation. Think that's how it's actually used in practice,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:47]</p>
<p>but we'll see. Alright. Well, I think you should do some homework with missus Kolmeier and get back to us. Alright. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:54]</p>
<p>so 14.5,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:41:55]</p>
<p>actually, I think the killer feature is the ability to unlock your iPhone with your Apple Watch. Depends on who you are, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:02]</p>
<p>Well, okay. In a pandemic,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:04]</p>
<p>wearing a mask, that is absolutely a killer feature.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:08]</p>
<p>I can tell you that I went out for lunch today, and it saved me a lot of frustration having to punch my like, it's just nice. It's it's a really smooth</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:17]</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:18]</p>
<p>I don't know why they didn't do it sooner</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:22]</p>
<p>because my watch has been unable to unlock my laptop</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:25]</p>
<p>for a long time now. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:28]</p>
<p>And and and quite frankly, it's about a year</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:31]</p>
<p>a year late in my estimation.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:42:33]</p>
<p>You know what doesn't work on, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:36]</p>
<p>The</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:42:39]</p>
<p>iPhone eight with touch ID. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:42:42]</p>
<p>The setting</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:42:44]</p>
<p>does not show up.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:46]</p>
<p>That's kinda sad. Now, I will say though, you've you've got touch ID, so it's it's probably less of a big deal, but I wonder why that is. I wonder if there's a technical reason for that. There's gotta be because, I mean, it's the OS.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:42:59]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:43:00]</p>
<p>I it it probably has something to do with the secure enclave and and updates that they've done. You're you're positive that it has nothing to do with your watch being too old. Like, you checked the version of your watch?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:43:10]</p>
<p>Oh, it could be the watch, but that's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:43:14]</p>
<p>it's turned on in the phone settings,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:43:16]</p>
<p>and it, like, didn't even show up.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:43:18]</p>
<p>Interesting. Oh, need to do some research on that. I I will tell you again, having having just done it, it's it's huge. It's really great. I'm I'm excited.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:43:27]</p>
<p>If you have trouble updating your Apple Watch Yeah. Which I did.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:43:33]</p>
<p>Remove all of your apps and turn off photo syncing. That's those are my two pro tips. That did not solve it for me. Oh, no. What did you have to do? So I reset the watch completely.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:43:42]</p>
<p>Oh, my. That's gross. Yep. I those older models don't have a lot of storage, unfortunately. No. It's like six gig.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:43:49]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:43:50]</p>
<p>And so my mom has this problem too. I'm I'm hoping to find out if mom got hers sorted out or not.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:43:56]</p>
<p>The the second biggest feature in this iOS release is app tracking.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:01]</p>
<p>So run into yet, but again, I don't use a lot of apps. Did you turn it off at the so there's a global toggle for app tracking in system settings. As you can just say, like, turn it off across the board. If you don't turn it off across the board, then each app is going to ask you individually and you can control it app by app.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:21]</p>
<p>I think we are going to see And that's on by default?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:25]</p>
<p>Mine was off by default. I so Oh, so that's where it is. So where was it? Privacy. It was under privacy, and you go under privacy. So settings. Track. Right? Privacy</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:34]</p>
<p>and then tracking. Allow apps to request to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:38]</p>
<p>track. And my guess is yours is off. Mine was off. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:41]</p>
<p>Yeah. Which,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:43]</p>
<p>gosh, can you imagine if</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:44:46]</p>
<p>If that was on by default?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:48]</p>
<p>I can. I felt yeah. Well, I mean, it would have been on by default in fourteen point four, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:53]</p>
<p>But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:54]</p>
<p>this is huge. I don't know who's gonna flip this on, first of all.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:44:58]</p>
<p>I I just did.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:00]</p>
<p>Did you really? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:01]</p>
<p>Alright. Well, you should report back and see who prompts. I think there's gonna have to be a flood of apps that are gonna have to release updates to leverage the prompt for this. Maybe I I don't I haven't looked enough at the APIs, but that's my guess.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:13]</p>
<p>But this is this is Apple sticking it to Facebook. Like, is a huge,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:18]</p>
<p>like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:20]</p>
<p>middle finger to Facebook. I I don't know how else to say it. Hopefully, didn't just lose our our clean rate. So the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:45:26]</p>
<p>tracking is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:45:28]</p>
<p>just blocked by default now?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:31]</p>
<p>I guess. And we should we should be clear too. This is tracking across apps.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:36]</p>
<p>Right. Right? And and so the profiling that comes because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:39]</p>
<p>you visited a website and,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:42]</p>
<p>like, leveraged something inside of a different app that Facebook is, like, just kinda introspecting through everything.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:48]</p>
<p>Does this</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:45:49]</p>
<p>work with Safari web pages?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:45:53]</p>
<p>That's probably I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:45:55]</p>
<p>I think it is different. I I do think it probably spans the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:00]</p>
<p>like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:01]</p>
<p>you can't be tracked from an app to website and back and forth. Right? And I I would guess that it probably gets in the way of that. So we'll like, we'll see. I think it remains to be seen how effective this is. I'm I'm hopeful. I think this is over to you. To mess around in the developer tools and see what's all available there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:18]</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:19]</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:20]</p>
<p>I've got other things I've gotta do in the developer tools right now, but but yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:25]</p>
<p>I I do I do think, though, this has got the potential to change</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:29]</p>
<p>the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:30]</p>
<p>landscape of app developers and what they can do with your information.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:34]</p>
<p>Think I this is a very Apple esque thing to do,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:37]</p>
<p>and I would I would hope that Google is a little ashamed after this comes out and follows suit.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:46:43]</p>
<p>So I guess we'll see. There you go. I wouldn't hold my breath. We'll see. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:46:48]</p>
<p>A feature I don't care about, but I think you actually will, John. You can now select your preferred streaming service.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:46:54]</p>
<p>Why do you think I'll care about this? Because you use Spotify.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:47:01]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:47:03]</p>
<p>There's a whole bunch of Siri mechanics, like when you tell it to play music or whatever, and now you can just default all of that over to Spotify rather than Yeah. To Apple</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:47:12]</p>
<p>So all those things that that Apple Music had a leg up on in the past no longer hold true.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:47:17]</p>
<p>Now, you know, Spotify or other services too, I guess they exist.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:21]</p>
<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:23]</p>
<p>I'm gonna jump down to podcasts</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:25]</p>
<p>because,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:26]</p>
<p>like, there's been a podcast war going on, and I don't think a lot of people know about it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:32]</p>
<p>But Spotify</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:33]</p>
<p>has, like, premium podcast stuff,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:37]</p>
<p>and Apple just announced their premium podcast stuff where you can, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:43]</p>
<p>get people to subscribe to podcasts for</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:45]</p>
<p>ad free listening. So if you didn't like our April fools episode, then that's for you, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:50]</p>
<p>But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:47:51]</p>
<p>There's also additional content. It's not just ad free, but but additional content. Yeah. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:47:57]</p>
<p>I don't see us doing anything like that soon</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:48:00]</p>
<p>because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:48:01]</p>
<p>we like to do this for free</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:48:03]</p>
<p>and get as many listeners as we can. Do do we though? I mean, do we really? I pay to do this. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:11]</p>
<p>But I I do think, like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:14]</p>
<p>Apple has</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:15]</p>
<p>probably</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:17]</p>
<p>staved off a lawsuit</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:18]</p>
<p>with this preferred streaming service thing. Yep. The podcast app</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:23]</p>
<p>competition or whatever you like, their their emergence into creating a marketplace</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:27]</p>
<p>for folks to sell their</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:30]</p>
<p>podcast content</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:31]</p>
<p>is definitely a play against Spotify. So it's kind of interesting. It's like, okay, Spotify. You've been upset that you can't choose a preferred streaming service. We'll give you that one, But we're coming for your other revenue, right, which is the podcast bit. Yep. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:45]</p>
<p>don't have any beef with Spotify. I just don't use it. I used it before Apple Music was a thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:51]</p>
<p>It's it's fine. I I I really just I just prefer the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:48:56]</p>
<p>I have not found a podcast that I'm gonna subscribe to yet, like, from the paid standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:49:01]</p>
<p>I'm looking for one though, because I I like I like this conception. I like the idea of supporting</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:49:05]</p>
<p>these creators</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:49:07]</p>
<p>that way. I like the idea of doing it in a secure ecosystem</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:49:11]</p>
<p>like Apple.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:49:12]</p>
<p>Think going out to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:49:14]</p>
<p>what is the thing that all the podcasters use so that you can support them?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:49:19]</p>
<p>Don't remember. Patreon or something? Patreon. Yeah. That's it. Yep. I again, I just I tend to air on the side of not spreading my financial information all across the Internet, and so having that centralized with Apple makes me feel good inside. And they make it stupid easy by allowing you to pay with Apple Pay.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:49:35]</p>
<p>Yep. Yep. Which is awesome. I'd like</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:49:38]</p>
<p>I really do love Apple Pay. I gotta tell man. I I was at a vending machine on my my drive up to Chicago last Friday, and I was able to just wave my watch</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:49:48]</p>
<p>and get a Twix bar. That's powerful. Like, if if if you wanna feel empowered, take your Apple watch and wave it like a wand at a vending machine and get that Snickers bar that you've been hoping for. I'm telling you, it's a game changer.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:03]</p>
<p>Maps. Maps is the other thing. This is, I think, a little bit of a dig at Google</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:08]</p>
<p>with the speed checks and accidents.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:10]</p>
<p>So again, you don't you don't drive anywhere, but Right. This I thought this was always a nice feature of Waze. I can't remember the last time that I used the maps app</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:50:20]</p>
<p>because the only place I've driven to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:50:23]</p>
<p>is church.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:25]</p>
<p>Do you you don't have alternate routes that you take based upon traffic or anything? No. There's no way they would compete with</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:50:32]</p>
<p>taking three eighty down to Iowa City.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:35]</p>
<p>So I will say that I I've got a lot of different ways that I can get to to various places in town.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:40]</p>
<p>It's like if I'm going to the brewery,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:42]</p>
<p>I will use Apple Maps even though I know how to get there because I don't know what's going on on, like, 465</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:48]</p>
<p>or, you know, maybe something down in the Fountain Square area Yeah. Is all jammed up. To be fair, Indianapolis traffic is much worse than probably anywhere in Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:50:58]</p>
<p>Fair fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:00]</p>
<p>I I'm looking forward to this though because the accident like, you're gonna actually be able to report accidents</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:04]</p>
<p>and you're gonna actually be able to report, like, hey, there's there's a cop car,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:09]</p>
<p>you know, probably taking</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:11]</p>
<p>your speed at this particular point and then see that. And and I think that was the thing about ways that I integration for these features?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:18]</p>
<p>That's a good question. I don't</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:20]</p>
<p>know. I think actually there is. I think when I opened up apps today, I got prompted for something like that. Nice. But I was in a rush to get out of the house, and so I didn't didn't mess with it. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:31]</p>
<p>would bet there is.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:32]</p>
<p>I I will look at accent and then she just takes your location, that would be cool. It would be. And I'll tell you what, that'd be a heck of a lot better than how it works on Waze because Yep. First of all, it's too many clicks,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:44]</p>
<p>and I always feel like I'm going to add to the accident. That's what it comes down to.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:49]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:51]</p>
<p>this to be you know, if if people are not totally sucked into the Waze</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:51:57]</p>
<p>world already, think this is just gonna add functionality to everybody's day to day. So I I think I think this is a good, you know, good thing to do. And again, I trust Apple to do this more than Google. This one comes down to.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:52:08]</p>
<p>Just real quick here, a couple of things that that stood out to me. AirPlay two for fitness plus. This is basically like streaming from your watch up to your Apple TV. I honestly can't believe that this wasn't a thing from the get go. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:52:22]</p>
<p>I I don't know what the story is there. It this probably just opens up the number of devices</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:52:27]</p>
<p>that Fitness plus can be streamed to. I think this really comes down to. So if you had some Bobo</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:52:32]</p>
<p>TV that, you know, back ported AirPlay two, like my TCL TV,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:52:37]</p>
<p>this will now be able to stream directly to it. That's really what the gist is. So if you've got a device, a a TV in particular,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:52:44]</p>
<p>that has AirPlay two support,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:52:46]</p>
<p>You did not you were not able to use Fitness plus before. Now you can. Right? For those that wanna exercise.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:52:53]</p>
<p>Xbox Series x and PlayStation five controller support on all the things. So I did this with the Apple TV.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:00]</p>
<p>Again, I think the the problem I ran into was Bluetooth range,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:04]</p>
<p>but it's kinda nice because I've got this expensive remote already in my house. I don't wanna buy yet another remote. I just wish they they did the Nintendo Switch because I've got a ton of those controllers. There you go.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:14]</p>
<p>And then maybe maybe the headline feature of the whole The thing that I actually care about.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:20]</p>
<p>Oh, really? Is this it? This is it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:23]</p>
<p>Okay. Is the ability to sort options</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:27]</p>
<p>in the reminders app, and and they called it enhanced sorting. So the first time you open up reminders, it actually prompts you. Like, this is this is such a big deal. You have you have to see the screen and hit click continue, but it says enhanced sorting. You can sort reminders in your smart lists manually</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:41]</p>
<p>by title,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:42]</p>
<p>due date, and more. Your sort order will sync across your devices.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:47]</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, you can also print lists. That's that's another new feature.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:52]</p>
<p>I I could not believe that they called this out the way that they did, Not just in the app, but in the so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:53:58]</p>
<p>much hate for it. Like I must have been, man. Like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:03]</p>
<p>I don't know. I can't say that I've really noticed this. Maybe I don't have enough Oh, I have. Have you? Okay. Maybe I just don't have enough stuff that I I stress out about</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:12]</p>
<p>how it sorts, but there like, it's so silly too. Like, literally, you right click on the list, and there's a sort by option,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:20]</p>
<p>and and you</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:21]</p>
<p>you click a button. And I guess now that syncs across.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:54:24]</p>
<p>How many how many task managers have you built in your</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:54:28]</p>
<p>years as a developer?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:30]</p>
<p>Tons.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:31]</p>
<p>Tons.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:54:32]</p>
<p>Like, isn't sort one of the major features that you have?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:54:35]</p>
<p>Like Well I guess you could just default to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:54:39]</p>
<p>the one that's due</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:54:42]</p>
<p>most</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:54:43]</p>
<p>closest to now is at the top.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:46]</p>
<p>Yeah. But That's usually what I've done. The thing the thing that I so there were some</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:52]</p>
<p>sort functionality in reminders. It didn't sync across devices. I think that was probably the So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:54:59]</p>
<p>I'm I'm real glad there was something for you this week, John, with Apple. Now the maps thing is pretty cool if I ever, you know, travel anywhere again. Leave the house. Or if you upgrade your iPhone, you'll be able to unlock it with your watch. Yes. That would be good too. That was very disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:55:15]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:55:16]</p>
<p>I'll have to see if it's a watch or a phone.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:19]</p>
<p>I I'd love to know. I'd love to know because I would have thought that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:23]</p>
<p>they would have a pretty wide berth in terms of coverage. It's gotta be a secure enclave limitation if if nothing else. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:31]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:32]</p>
<p>that was a lot, John. I wasn't expecting to to get so deep in all of that. Just coming back after a long break. Yeah. Going up on an hour.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:40]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:41]</p>
<p>For for next time, we'll just give a little teaser. I'd like to talk about garage door openers after after our,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:48]</p>
<p>listener induced</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:50]</p>
<p>episode</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:51]</p>
<p>about our top 10 non Apple products.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:55:55]</p>
<p>I I I went and bought something. I'd also like to talk about monitor woes because I have had a heck of an experience</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:56:02]</p>
<p>upgrading a monitor. And last but certainly not least, I'd like to talk about cameras</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:56:07]</p>
<p>on the outside that watch people and things.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:56:10]</p>
<p>So there you go. If you made it this far, dear listener, and you're like, I can't imagine what they would possibly talk about next week, it's those three things. We're gonna talk about those three things. And probably another listener idea, if you have more listener ideas, you can always send them to us. Send them to John because I don't read my email anymore.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:56:26]</p>
<p>You</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:56:27]</p>
<p>can you can do it through our contacts page on our website at <a href="http://twist11pod.com">twist11pod.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:56:31]</p>
<p>You can do it on Twitter and even on Facebook. We're still there for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:56:36]</p>
<p>And please leave your five star reviews on iTunes. Got anything else, John?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:56:40]</p>
<p>Nope. I think that's it. Alright. Well, this is Stan Lemon still reminding you to help control the spread of COVID nineteen. Wash your hands, wear a mask, and go get your vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:57:06]</p>
<p>So tell me about this Ponzi scheme that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:57:09]</p>
<p>missus Lemon was starting or had an idea for or something that. This has been a long running Ponzi scheme. As far as I can tell, it's been going on for at least,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:57:18]</p>
<p>gosh, at least a year and a few months.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:57:21]</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:57:22]</p>
<p>you know, I've talked I think I've talked about this before. RoosterMoney, the app that that I use to to track chores and money with my kids. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:57:30]</p>
<p>Basically, like, each kid has an account, and they have a set of tasks that they can mark off each day, and I approve them. They're worth a certain amount of money, and so they've got a they've got a bucket of cash that they amass over time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:57:42]</p>
<p>It's how, you know, I I I pay them for taking the dog out or Lucy mowing the lawn, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:57:49]</p>
<p>And and over the course of the last year,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:57:53]</p>
<p>when the kids have either found money, which happens a surprising amount of time, like, you would not believe the amount of coinage that's just, like, laying on the road and sidewalks and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:03]</p>
<p>But also if they get a gift for their birthday or Christmas or whatever and they get, you know, $5 here, $10 here, we have told them that they could convert that cash into rooster money. Right? And so basically, they give that cash to missus Lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:15]</p>
<p>Missus Lemon puts it into her purse presumably,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:20]</p>
<p>and then, you know, allocates some money to rooster money. Now, when the kids finally wanna buy something or whatever they do, right, like Henry went to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:28]</p>
<p>a comic store, took him to a comic store and he bought some, like, higher end</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:33]</p>
<p>Pokemon cards.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:35]</p>
<p>When I I put that on my credit card. Right? Yep. And then I deduct the money from Mr. Mike. That's the that's the flow of cash. True. If you rewind</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:43]</p>
<p>last like, a year ago, February. Right? February 2020, I went to Disney World with my whole family,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:51]</p>
<p>and for whatever reason, I always get cash before we go. Right? It's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:58:56]</p>
<p>always have traveled with cash.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:58:58]</p>
<p>Yeah. I I don't know Some sort of paranoia. It is. I'm not sure where it comes from. I don't it's probably I've it's something my parents always did. They always had to go to the bank before we went on a vacation, and so it's just instilled in my head. Now, over time, the amount of money that I pulled from the bank has gotten less. Right? And the nice thing about Disney World is is you really don't have to have cash at all, you know? Right. There's there's absolutely no reason for it with the exception of maybe a tip on the drive over and a tip on the drive back,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:59:25]</p>
<p>but you can get through everything else in park</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:59:27]</p>
<p>and in the resorts without it. Nonetheless, you know,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:59:31]</p>
<p>a year ago from February, I got cash, a couple $100.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:59:35]</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:59:36]</p>
<p>And we went to Disney World, and we spent some of it, but not a lot. I'd say, like, there was, like, a $120 left over or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:59:45]</p>
<p>Over the course of the pandemic, there were a few opportunities where we were able to use that. Right? So, like, we went to a farmer's market and spent some of it, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:59:55]</p>
<p>I I started to notice though that the amount of money in missus Lemon's cash reserves was not going away.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:03]</p>
<p>Right? And and it what triggered for me was missus Lemon would say, like, I have to go run this errand.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:09]</p>
<p>I'm gonna stop by and buy some fabric at Joanne's or I'm gonna buy some pens at Michael's, that kind of thing. Right? And I get to thinking about it. I'm sitting there one day, I'm like, you know, this this stuff's all adding up</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:20]</p>
<p>And there's no way that that Disney World money unless like this is like a leprechaun moment with a pot of gold, there's no way that this</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:26]</p>
<p>Disney World money still exists.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:29]</p>
<p>Sure. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:30]</p>
<p>watched</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:32]</p>
<p>as one of the kids handed missus Lemon, I think, like a $5 bill to convert into rooster money cash.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:38]</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, it dawned on me</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:41]</p>
<p>that that basically, she's been amassing this cash.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:45]</p>
<p>Right? Going out and buying her stuff</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:48]</p>
<p>while while credit to the the the kids' accounts, and then, you know, it's coming out of the normal normal cash flow. And as I sat there and I thought about it then</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:00:56]</p>
<p>and this is on his defense, I don't believe that she meant anything nefarious by this.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:02]</p>
<p>Nonetheless Nobody wants to run to the bank to deposit cash. Apparently not. Yeah. Wait. We And even had conversation about this. She's like, our our bank doesn't have branches. How would I do that? I'm like, ATMs work both ways. You know, you can put money into an ATM. You don't have to just take it out.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:16]</p>
<p>But suffice to say like, I think that is the actual definition of a Ponzi scheme. Right? Like there is this there's this thing of money</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:24]</p>
<p>and you're saying it exists,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:26]</p>
<p>right, on a ledger,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:28]</p>
<p>but then you're going, you're buying, you know, apparently art supplies. But but again, like, what separates missus Lemon from say Bernie Madoff is just a bunch of zeros at the end of the day, you know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:01:41]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:01:42]</p>
<p>there's only one victim and that's you.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:45]</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:46]</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:47]</p>
<p>except So so here's the thing though. I explained this all to the kids. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:52]</p>
<p>I laid this all out so they could understand exactly what was happening.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:01:56]</p>
<p>And Evelyn, in her infinite wisdom said, but daddy, you would you would still honor that rooster money. And I looked at her and I had to say, you know what? You think twice about you putting money in the Bank of Mommy. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:08]</p>
<p>And so now now they're all second guessing the Bank of Mommy</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:12]</p>
<p>and and whether or they'll be able to get their money out of rooster money. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:16]</p>
<p>That's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:17]</p>
<p>hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:19]</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:20]</p>
<p>this is just my rough back of the napkin math. I think we're talking about roughly 200.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:25]</p>
<p>I think that's how much money has has gotten exchanged here. So I'm a little disappointed and ashamed of myself that I didn't catch it sooner.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:02:33]</p>
<p>But you know what this also means?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:02:35]</p>
<p>What? That missus Lemon's hobby budget needs to be increased.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:40]</p>
<p>What what a hobby budget? She despise what she wants, man. Like, that's the thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:46]</p>
<p>I I finally explained to her like, there's no reason for you to like keep</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:02:50]</p>
<p>the money in your purse to spend for art supplies. Like, if you do something, you just get it. There's no reason not to. The only the only reason to buy it this way with the cash is so that we can't track it, you know? Right. And When I said that, she smiled, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:03:04]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:04]</p>
<p>That was the goal.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:06]</p>
<p>Missus Kollmeyer likes to have cash on hand too.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:03:09]</p>
<p>I'm telling you, there could be a Ponzi scheme going on there too. So so guys like you and I who spend way too much time looking at the ledgers for our checking and credit card accounts, they're they're probably</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:03:20]</p>
<p>they're</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:03:22]</p>
<p>we probably have driven our wives to do this is is legit.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:26]</p>
<p>I will say that missus Kolmeyer's cash reserves were able to pull off a fantastic</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:32]</p>
<p>surprise thirtieth birthday party for me. Well, there you go. There you go. I wasn't I wasn't able I wasn't onto it at all. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:39]</p>
<p>where I would have been if there were random transactions.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:03:42]</p>
<p>Yep. Yeah. You would have been like a hog. It's just like, you know, Chris Christmas time. How does how does Anna buy you a Christmas present?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:48]</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:50]</p>
<p>I mean, usually, if it's coming from Amazon, like, doesn't really matter.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:54]</p>
<p>It just shows up as Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:03:57]</p>
<p>One, she bought me concert tickets, and she</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:04:00]</p>
<p>went through our friend Kristen Sanchez, wife of Dan Chess.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:04]</p>
<p>Oh, so she has coconspirators?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:04:07]</p>
<p>Yes. She does. Alright. Well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:10]</p>
<p>I don't even know what to make of that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:13]</p>
<p>I think miss missus Levin has done similar things with her mother. So I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:18]</p>
<p>know, again, like, joint account,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:21]</p>
<p>the way we obsess over things,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:23]</p>
<p>I get it. I totally get it. Yep. But a Ponzi scheme, John. A Ponzi scheme. I don't know if I would go that far. Oh, it totally is.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:32]</p>
<p>Listen, someday when I'm an old econ professor, I'm gonna still be using this example that works for the Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [01:04:40]</p>
<p>Nice. That would be cool though. I'd take your econ class. Yeah. I'm sure you would.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:46]</p>
<p>Alright. That's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [01:04:47]</p>
<p>a wrap.</p>
