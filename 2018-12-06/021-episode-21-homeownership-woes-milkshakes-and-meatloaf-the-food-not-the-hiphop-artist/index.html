    <p>Dear Faithful Listener,</p>
<p>Today Jon's audio quality is a little deteriorated due to recording at home. Why is he at home and not in Studio? The joys of home ownership. Listen in to hear Jon's first fix as a homeowner.</p>
<p>Next up, Stan has 2 reviews on milkshakes. First a milkshake from the Atlanta airport based on a recommendation. He doesn't have a great review of it.</p>
<p>Next he returned to the scene of the original good Five Guys milkshake. This visit isn't up to par.</p>
<p>Milkshake quality depends on craftsmanship and employees taking pride in their work.</p>
<p>We got a couple more iTunes reviews that we want to shout out to. Thanks for listening and taking time to leave feedback. We really appreciate it!</p>
<p>After a quick update on the donate to Pastor Fritsche campaign, Stan and Jon talk meatloaf.</p>
<p>They even decide what they'll talk about next week while on air.</p>
<p>Donate to Fritsche, let us know. You'll want to read the letter that comes with the sticker.</p>
<p>Talk next week,</p>
<p>-Jon Kohlmeier &amp; Stan Lemon
