<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>After some quick followup on Aldi and their lack of maraschino cherries, we get into why we missed last week's episode.</p>
<p>Eastern Iowa looks like a war zone. Cedar Rapids has lost at least 50% of its tree canopy. The Iowa Twist of Lemon bunker was hit by a tree after straight line winds that reached speeds equivalent to a Category 4 Hurricane. This resulted in Jon being without power for 151 hours. There are still over 20,000 people without power as of posting this episode a week and a half after the storm hit.</p>
<p>Listen in to hear Jon's experience during the storm and the week after it hit and start working on his three helpful things to make it through natural disaster.</p>
<p>1.) Find a friend like Stan Lemon. 2.) Have a sizable emergency fund for the unexpected. 3.) Trust in the Lord who is continually more helpful than governments.</p>
<p>Recovery will be a long process both at the Iowa bunker and in Eastern Iowa. We'll keep you updated as we repair and rebuild.</p>
<p>Finally Stan wants to talk about Fortnite and Apple and the App Store. Jon doesn't know much about what is going on, but Stan has strong feelings.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet please subscribe using your favorite podcast app and we'll be back next week! (Barring any natural disasters).</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
