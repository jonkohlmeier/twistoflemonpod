<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan did not pay any attention to the Jeopardy! Greatest of all Time tournament, but Jon was very excited about it.</p>
<p>We follow up on the ad blocker discussion from last week.</p>
<p>The conversation degrades a bit as Stan complains about his shoe buying process.</p>
<p>From Jon's point of view the conversation gets much better when Stan tells him that he recently finished The Hobbit - even if he didn't like it that much. (Make sure you listen to the bonus round today!)</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
