<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We have an exciting campaign going on during the month of December. We're looking to support Pastor Joel Fritsche and his work in the Dominican Republic. Here's the deal, you donate - send us proof of donating $50 or more and we'll send you a limited edition Life with a Twist of Lemon sticker (3&quot; x 3&quot;).</p>
<p>Even better is Stan will be matching the first $1000 raised.</p>
<p>Listen in to hear about the work of Pastor Fritsche with the seminary in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>From there Stan has *another* beef with CPH study notes. He rants a little bit. I apologize to our non-LCMS listeners for the inside baseball. Jon calls people out by name... overall it's a bitter segment. You can skip it if you'd like. (Props to CPH for no more red algae).</p>
<p>Finally we switch gears to Tech. Stan quit Gmail this week. We talk about Google, security and the evolution of correspondence and email.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in and we hope to be sending you a sticker soon!</p>
<p>- Jon Kohlmeier</p>
