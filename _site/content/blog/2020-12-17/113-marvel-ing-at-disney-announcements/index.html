<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we have a first in the history of the podcast. Three people recording from three different states. Last week's Disney announcements at their virtual Investor Day left only one person in our mind who could help us do it justice. None other than our friend and yours, Patrick Sturdivant.</p>
<p>We cover the plethora of Marvel announcements, Star Wars announcements, and many of the other things.</p>
<p>This episode, might not be for anyone other than diehard Marvel fans, but it's lots of high quality content for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>Patrick wanted us to note that he made an error when talking about Dr. Strange - Nightmare, reportedly, is the villain in Dr. Strange.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon, Jon Kohlmeier &amp; Special Guest Patrick Sturdivant</p>
