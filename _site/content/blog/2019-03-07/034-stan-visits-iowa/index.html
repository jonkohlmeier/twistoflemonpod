<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week Stan and Jon are recording from the same room for the first time ever. Stan made it to Cedar Rapids for the weekend.</p>
<p>Stan talks about what we've done so far in Iowa including a trip to the Almost Famous Popcorn shop. Stan wasn't overly impressed with his Cookie dough Milkshake.</p>
<p>Spoilers for next week - we'll be taking a trip to the Hamburg Inn 02.</p>
<p>Stan also goes on a rant about &quot;The Customer is always right.&quot;</p>
<p>Other Iowa adventures included Jon playing bartender for Stan, pork tenderloins, eating Mexican food, and a trip to Lowes.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about Stan's Iowa visit next week. Until then - stay sour!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
