<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week Stan took a field trip to try out It's Just Wings. Stan enjoys the wings with Joe, listener to the show. He starts off with smoked buffalo wings as a baseline. Listen in for his reactions, but we think he'll be back to try the fried Oreos.</p>
<p>Next up we talk about this week's iPhone event, new chip, new camera and updated screen. Bonus was the announcement of a HomePod mini. Stay tuned to future episodes to see if either host makes any purchases.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear share with a friend!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
