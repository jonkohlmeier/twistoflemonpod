<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're going to have to adjust next week's recording schedule so that Stan (and hopefully Jon) can get some good gaming in.</p>
<p>Mandalorian Season 2 is now airing. Get Stan's reaction to the first episode of season 2 and Jon's reaction to everything.</p>
<p>Update on Jon's house including the impromptu garage door repair.</p>
<p>We also cover Mint premium, what we can of the election and more!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>- Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
