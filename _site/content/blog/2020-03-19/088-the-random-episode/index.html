<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan thinks we're scraping the bottom of the barrel for this episode. The first item on the list was current favorite song.</p>
<p>There's a new Black Widow trailer out what they're calling the &quot;Final Trailer&quot; We talk about new things in the trailer. We're looking forward to it with cautious optimism.</p>
<p>We briefly cover tree trimming and Grilled cheese anniversary. We also have no 2020 podcast reviews.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
