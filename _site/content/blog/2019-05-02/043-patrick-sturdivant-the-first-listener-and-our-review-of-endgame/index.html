<p>Listeners Assemble!</p>
<p>This is an exciting episode for Marvel and LWATOL fans alike. We're recording directly after not one but TWO showings of Avengers: Endgame. Around the Lemon dining room table sit Jon Kohlmeier and special guest Patrick Sturdivant. (We missed you Borghardt!).</p>
<p>Listen in as we talk about dinner at St. Elmo's Steakhouse, Avengers: Endgame, and some exciting moments in between.</p>
<p>There are spoilers. If you haven't seen Endgame and don't want it spoiled, DO NOT. We repeat DO NOT, listen to this episode until after you've seen it.</p>
<p>But it's been a week.. so what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
