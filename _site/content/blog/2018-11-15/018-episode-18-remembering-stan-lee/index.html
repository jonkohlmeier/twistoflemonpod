<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>You can measure short distances on Google Maps! That tip alone is worth listening to this episode.</p>
<p>A new Italian Beef place opened up in Cedar Rapids, I give my review (unfortunately no milkshakes on the menu). Stan describes what an Italian beef is, because apparently they're kind of a regional thing.</p>
<p>Stan Lee died this week, we remember the creator of Marvel and spend some time talking about his work.</p>
<p>I voted... and started more political talk. The episode is saved with a Jon Moving Update. Stan is surviving life and the Lemon house doesn't appear to be falling apart this week.</p>
<p>Listen in, have fun, write a review on iTunes: we'll be talking about some on air next week!</p>
<p>Talk to you later,</p>
<p>Jon Kohlmeier
