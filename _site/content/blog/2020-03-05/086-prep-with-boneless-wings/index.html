<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>&quot;Boneless&quot; Thugs N Harmony is making a promo video for Buffalo Wild Wings. We talk about Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Stan's history with BW's and why you can probably make better wings at home.</p>
<p>No sound bite from Fenker for this week, but Stan has a pretty good excuse for why he couldn't make it happen.</p>
<p>Stan has a post-Disney shoe update for us. He seems happier with them now that they've been broken in.</p>
<p>Finally, Stan has started prepping. He's now ready to survive a Zombie apocalypse or mutant strains of coronavirus.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear please leave us a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
