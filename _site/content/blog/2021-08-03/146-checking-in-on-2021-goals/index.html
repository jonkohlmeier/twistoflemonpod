<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today we do a mid-year-ish check in on our goals for 2021 that we set back in <a href="https://twistoflemonpod.com/headed-into-a-new-year/">Episode 115: Headed into a New Year</a>.</p>
<p>Overall we're doing okay on our goals. Hopefully only to improve as the year continues.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
