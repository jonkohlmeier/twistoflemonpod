<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Welcome to season 2 with a twist of Lemon. Stan starts off with a new season resolution to find Jon a new router. Will this be the year that burger reviews take the place of milkshake reviews?</p>
<p>Stan has been having an existential crisis of whether we continue the podcast or not.</p>
<p>We have a new review! Thanks Angie for the review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Jon has a dream where his wife, Anna and Stan's wife Sara become the best of friends. He nudged it a little bit this week but pushing for a phone call.</p>
<p>To round out the episode Stan and Jon talk about the upcoming Star Trek series Picard.</p>
<p>Finally, Endgame is out! Stan has been working his way through the rewatch.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
