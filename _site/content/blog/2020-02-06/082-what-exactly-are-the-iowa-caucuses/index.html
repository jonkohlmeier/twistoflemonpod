<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan has a lot of questions for the LWATOL resident Iowan following the fallout this week from the Caucuses. Now's your chance to get a nickel look into what exactly the Iowa caucuses are.</p>
<p>We briefly review Episode 2 of Picard. Not as great as episode one, but some bright spots.</p>
<p>Stan watched the Super Bowl, Jon did not. We talk about it anyway.. but mostly the food.</p>
<p>This week's life tip is Start Meetings on Time.</p>
<p>Stan has some great insights into Mastering Minimalism when it comes to paper.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about some new Facebook Privacy check features and the state of internet privacy.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, leave a 5 star review on iTunes and tune in next week for the Pre-Lemon Disney Trip episode.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
