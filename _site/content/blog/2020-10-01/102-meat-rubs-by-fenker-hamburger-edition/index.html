<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week Stan wanted to record early so he wouldn't miss the presidential debate.</p>
<p>We have an update on lawn care in Indianapolis and in Cedar Rapids. Stan has gone app crazy with the app library function. And he bought new shoes, it didn't take 3 months this time.</p>
<p>The main event in this episode is the Meat Rubs by Fenker hamburger seasoning taste test. Both Stan and Jon tried 3 different burger seasonings. Listen in for their reactions and which one we hope that Fenker mass produces.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening! If you like what you hear, please share with a friend.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
<p>P.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/aJZFLXLgzTA">Check out Stan's YouTube video from his tasting.</a></p>
