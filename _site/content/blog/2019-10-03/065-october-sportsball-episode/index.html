<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We started recording to try to get ahead before Stan's upcoming travels. Turns out the episode we recorded for next week was very time sensitive as we talk about Post-Season baseball.</p>
<p>Listen in to our take on this years October baseball. We also discuss the dismissal of our teams managers Clint Hurdle from the Pirates and Joe Madden from the Cubs.</p>
<p>Definitely a sportsball focused episode but we'll be back next week with our normal discussing topics all over the place.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and we hope you'll leave a review.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
