<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we talk about Jon's birthday dinner last week including a milkshake review and kicks off our topic of regional foods you should probably only order in that region.</p>
<p>We also have an update on Jon's home repairs and talk about Lucy Lemon's newest Apple gadget.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, Let us know if you home town has any really delicious cuisine that we shouldn't order anywhere else.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
