<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Rejoice with us as we celebrate our first year of podcasting as Life with a Twist of Lemon!</p>
<p>To kick it off Stan wants to talk about the Marvel Phase 4 announcements. Don't let that stop you from making it through to the reminiscing on the last year. (Skip to 11 minutes if you're so inclined).</p>
<p>We talk about how the podcast came to be, some of our favorite parts of the last year, and some of our listeners favorite parts!</p>
<p>Milkshakes, Marvel, Jon buying a house, the great Grilled Cheese controversy, and other random things that stood out.</p>
<p>Thanks for wasting spending the last year with us. If you feel so inclined please leave a five-star review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Stay Sour, friends,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
