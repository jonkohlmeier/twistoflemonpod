<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan spent the week in Atlanta so Jon wasn't sure if they were going to have anything to talk about. Jon planned a couple items of discussion but then all the news dropped out of D23 (which you may or may not care about, but we do.)</p>
<p>We're excited about Ewan McGregor's return to the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The upcoming Mandalorian series. We touch on some other D23 announcements.</p>
<p>Next up we talk about The Rise of Skywalker trailer that dropped this week. Stan didn't get rick-rolled like he was expecting, but overall the trailer doesn't tell us much about the movie.</p>
<p>Then we get to one of Jon's topics - Email best practices.<br>
Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use an appropriate Subject Line</li>
<li>Respond within one business day.</li>
<li>Make clear requests for next actions</li>
<li>Your email should be highly skim-able.</li>
<li>Don't add too many people to the email.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listen in and share some of your email tips!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
