<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>If you're sick of milkshake talk skip the first 3.5 minutes. From there we rejoice in our first iTunes written review AND the first great mystery of Life with a Twist of Lemon.</p>
<p>Jon used the Meat Rubs by Fenker that he received in the mail and gives his review.</p>
<p>Bad news for Netflix / Marvel Fans. Stan and Jon discuss the cancellation of Luke Cage and Iron Fist.</p>
<p>Jon gives an update on the House Hunt.</p>
<p>Finally - Stan suggests a book for Jon to read: &quot;Creative Selection.&quot; A book that Stan says is one of the best books in technology. Jon also wants to make a look at &quot;It doesn't have to be crazy at work.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks for listening - leave a review and we just might talk about you too!</p>
<p>- Jon Kohlmeier
