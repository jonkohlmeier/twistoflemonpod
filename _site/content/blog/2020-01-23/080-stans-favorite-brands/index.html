<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today Jon is recording from the St. Louis area, we try to find out if there is a specific St. Louis cuisine and get an update on Stan's shoe decision.</p>
<p>Stan also tells us about his robocalls vacuum and per request from one of our favorite listeners (Mrs. Lemon), we talk about Stan's odd brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
