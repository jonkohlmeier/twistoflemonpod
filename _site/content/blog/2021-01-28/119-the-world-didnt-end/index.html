<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>The world didn't end as we speculated it might while recording last week. We touch on the inauguration before jumping into WandaVision Episode 3.</p>
<p>There were some big turns during episode 3, but still stuck with the same format. Stan and Jon are both interested to see where it goes.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, If you like what you hear please share with a friend.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
