<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today Stan kicks off the episode with another correction from last week's episode.</p>
<p>The Apple live event has come and gone listen in to hear Stan and Jon's take. We talk Apple News, Apple Pay, Apple Arcade, Apple Channels, and Apple TV+.</p>
<p>This week Patrick had good Marvel Intel! We have Avengers Endgame tickets. The story of acquiring the tickets is worth listening to in itself.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and leaving reviews!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
