<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're bummed that Jon's sister Liz is no longer a regular listener. We're not sure when exactly she stopped listening. So this week no Star Wars, Marvel or Salesforce talk. We even talk about a topic specifically requested by Liz.</p>
<p>Most of Jon's family came to visit for Labor Day weekend. You'll get a brief update on that weekend and how Jon handles people as an introvert.</p>
<p>We discuss why Stan gave Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism only 2 stars (not the 5 that you should give us on iTunes.) Listen in to why Stan went with that review.</p>
<p>We talk about Stan's computer woes - specifically around Catalina. Stan is back up and running. Things might even be backed up by now.</p>
<p>Finally we clear the topic backlog by talking about our work station. Listen in to how Stan and Jon keep up their desks organized and what are regularly on it.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening!</p>
