<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we recorded early because Stan was going on a vacation to nowhere to do nothing. But at least he's taking some time off. Hopefully someone camped with him.</p>
<p>We follow up on Jon's first meat smoking adventure. Listen in to hear how the chicken turned out.</p>
<p>Finally Jon has been watching Gotham recently listen in to his reactions of Season 1 and the first several episodes of Season 2.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear please share with a friend and review us on your favorite podcasting app.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
