<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan is very upset and very opinionated on Grilled Cheese. So we spend some time following up.</p>
<p>Next up we have two new iTunes reviews bringing us to a total of 11! Thanks friends.</p>
<p>Jon learned some valuable lessons on digital marketing by boosting their first post on Facebook. Listen in to hear about lessons learned.</p>
<p>We've started a Milkshake movement.. so milkshake reviews probably aren't over with just yet.</p>
<p>Somehow that leads in to Pokemon.. card game, PokemonGo, animated series and more.</p>
<p>We almost make it through the episode without mentioning the new Avengers trailer! Jon catches it and we talk through the trailer before signing off for this week.</p>
<p>Listen at your own risk. Leave a review.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
