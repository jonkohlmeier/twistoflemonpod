<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We kick off the episode talking about Fun Dip and flashing back to Valentine's Day (perks of being the spouse of an elementary school teacher).</p>
<p>Jon gives his review of TenderShack the new-ish offering on Door Dash and we end the episode talking about the WandaVision episode that Stan told us more about than the actual episode did.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
