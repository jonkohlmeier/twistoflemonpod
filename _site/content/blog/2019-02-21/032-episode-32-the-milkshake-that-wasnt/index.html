<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan had 2 milkshakes this week. Bringing our total milkshake reviews up to 3 in 2019. Listen in to hear what he thought about Potbelly's and Oberweis's takes on milkshakes. We also found what could be a milkshake abomination, but we haven't tried it yet. (Sorry Crusade Burger).</p>
<p>If you were stranded on a desert island and you could only take one country music album, what would it be? Jon and Stan weigh in. We want to hear what your album would be. Leave a comment on Facebook!</p>
<p>Jon got his snow blower and was ready to go for the impending snow storm.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about Amazon HQ2 bailing on New York. Stan and Jon weigh in.</p>
<p>We touch on resumes a little bit to keep our promise form last episode.</p>
<p>Grab a milkshake and listen in!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
