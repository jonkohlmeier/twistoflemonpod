<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Last week, Jon had an idea for a discussion topic - What makes a good meeting. So that's what we spend the majority of this episode talking about.</p>
<p>Stan is also headed on vacation this week, he gives a little preview of what he'll be up to.</p>
<p>Stan lays out 3 types of meetings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trying to Find Something Out (Receive Information)</li>
<li>Trying to Explain Something (Share information)</li>
<li>Trying to Collaborate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Listen in as we take a not very organized approach to talking about meetings, what meetings should have, and some things that throw them off course.</p>
<p>That leads into a brief discussion on actual productivity vs. productivity theatre. In general we conclude that &quot;productivity theatre&quot; tries to address a symptom rather than the core problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
