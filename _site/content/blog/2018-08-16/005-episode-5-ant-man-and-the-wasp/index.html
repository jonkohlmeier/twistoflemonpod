<p>Dear Faithful Listener,</p>
<p>This week we release episode 5 of the <strong>Life with a Twist of Lemon</strong> podcast. Â Stan and I recently saw <strong>Ant Man and the Wasp</strong>. So we take a look at the movie itself and its place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You should probably watch the movie first if you don't want it spoiled.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen the movie and don't care about spoilers, listen in for the MCU insights.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jon Kohlmeier
