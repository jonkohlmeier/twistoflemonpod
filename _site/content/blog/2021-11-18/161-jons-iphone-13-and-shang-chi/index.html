<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan kicks off this episode asking for an update on the iPhone after having it for 1 week. Then we jump into discussing Shang-Chi (Now that it hit Disney+ so we could watch it.)</p>
<p>Finally we have a conversation about social media history and ephemeral content.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
