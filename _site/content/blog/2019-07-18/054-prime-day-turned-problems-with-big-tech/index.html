<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're getting closer to our 1 year anniversary.. but not quite there yet. Which is a blessing in disguise because Stan isn't completely on board with Jon's idea yet.</p>
<p>We follow up last week where we question the accessibility of the Touch Bar. Turns out the Touch Bar is extremely accessible. See the link in the show notes below. This leads into an overall Accessibility discussion.</p>
<p>Then we switch into the week's big news: Amazon Prime Day. This year Prime Day was a two day event. Both Jon and Stan took part in this years Prime Day.</p>
<p>This leads into a video that Jon sent over to Stan on Elizabeth Warren breaking up big tech.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
