<p>This week Stan wants to discuss how he goes through life - setting and keeping personal and household rules. Listen in to what types of rules he sets, how he uses them, and what they protect him from.</p>
<p>Then we talk about the 3rd Episode of Hawkeye and the state of Marvel TV shows so far.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
