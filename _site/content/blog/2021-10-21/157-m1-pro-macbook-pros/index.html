<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we talk about our tasting of the Culvers Curderburger. (I think we both were rather unimpressed). Then we jump into discussing this week's apple event. We briefly touch on the music announcements before jumping into the M1 Pro and M1 Max new MacBook Pros.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
