<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we kick off the episode with some banter about iCloud Drive and Jon's most recent self-reliance achievement.</p>
<p>The bulk of the episode is our review of the the 2016 Hamilton recording that was released on Disney+. We tell you the good, the bad, and why you should probably watch even if you don't think that you'd enjoy it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening. If you have friends who like Hamilton share this episode with them!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
