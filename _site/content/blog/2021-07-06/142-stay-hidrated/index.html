<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Jon is recording from Louisville and will be visiting Stan on the way back. We do some research into what constitutes &quot;Kentucky food&quot; and settle on bourbon.</p>
<p>Stan has been getting tweets from LG about his LG Ultrafine review from a couple months ago. We'll have to wait and see if he'll turn into the next spokesperson.</p>
<p>Finally we review the <a href="https://amzn.to/3hgZInc">HidrateSpark Steel</a> water bottle. Both Stan and Jon got one recently and have mixed feeling about it.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
