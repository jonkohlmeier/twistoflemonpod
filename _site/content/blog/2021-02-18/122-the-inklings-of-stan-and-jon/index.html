<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We lost the first thirteen minutes of this week's episode due to Jon's internet going down, so we had to do a take two. This led into a discussion of all things Narnia and Lord of The Rings.</p>
<p>From there we touch on episode 6 of WandaVision, the M1 MacBook Air and coming up on a year of the pandemic.Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
