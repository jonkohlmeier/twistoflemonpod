<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We have another review on iTunes! Then Stan yells at Jon for his terrible audio quality last week.</p>
<p>This is the week! Jon is currently in Indianapolis. We're excited for Endgame. It's finally here!</p>
<p>Stan is paying attention to baseball again. At least currently because the Pirates have the best record in the National league.</p>
<p>We talk through how we would rank the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>Listen in and stay tuned to our Endgame Episode guest starring the one, the only, Patrick Sturdivant.</p>
