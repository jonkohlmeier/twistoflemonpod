<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Milkshakes return! Stan visited a gourmet Milkshake shop and Jon got a Shamrock shake. Stan gives Jon a hard time about not liking mint.</p>
<p>From there we have an update on our most used apps. Stan is still using most of the native Apple apps Reminders, Calendar, Notes, etc.</p>
<p>We also cover development tools, weather apps, and other notes of interest.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear please leave us a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
