<p>Dear Listener who may in fact be sick of hearing us talk about milkshakes,</p>
<p>This week we talk about Milkshakes! Stan's Portillo's milkshake to be exact. He had an interesting experience. He tells it better than I do. But this picture is referenced...</p>
<p><img src="./IMG_6447.jpg" alt="Stan's portillo's milkshake"></p>
<p>Other topics covered - Apple event, Cocktails, and other deliciously crafted items.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jon Kohlmeier &amp; Stan Lemon</p>
