<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>In this episode, Stan Lemon reviews Meat Rubs by Fenker (or.. Meat, Rubbed, and Salutary - branding pending.) Stan gives a good review but the only way to get them are to be friends with Rev. Aaron Fenker.</p>
<p>Stan got new Apple Gear, much of the world got new apple software, listen in for our discussion on that.</p>
<p>Milkshakes appeared, of course. You can hear a tale of two Five Guys milkshakes.</p>
<p>And to wrap it all up we get to what we planned to talk about. Investing 101. We talk saving strategies and basic investing.</p>
<p>If that doesn't give you a good idea of what life with a Twist of Lemon is... I don't know what will.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with us!</p>
