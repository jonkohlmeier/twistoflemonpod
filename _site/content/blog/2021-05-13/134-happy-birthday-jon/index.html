<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we celebrate Jon's 32nd birthday! Stan and Jon talk about birthday traditions growing up and how Stan doesn't really remember May.</p>
<p>Stan also talks about his twitter adventure with Johnsonville and Oscar Mayer.</p>
<p>August Derecho repairs continue and Jon is starting to see the light at the end of tunnel. When those are over the next project will probably be to move away from the Alexa ecosystem.</p>
<p>Finally we cover another listener submitted idea talking about some of our favorite life hacks.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
