<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today we are joined by Jon's father in law, because Jon didn't do enough research to talk about Fitness+ enough for Stan's liking.</p>
<p>Rev. Mark Buetow is a board-gaming extraordinaire and pastor of Zion Lutheran Church in McHenry, IL. He has previously used Beach Body and has been using Fitness+ regularly since its launch.</p>
<p>We talk about initial reactions and how Fitness+ shows off the best, the worst, and the emerging aspects of Apple.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening if you like what you hear, please share with a friend!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
