<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We kick off the episode talking about Manhattans which turns into a Milkshake check-in.</p>
<p>We review and comment on some listener comments. Angie left a comment with some suggestions for our 2020 resolutions/goals.</p>
<p>Stan continues his trend of getting rid of things that no longer bring him joy. He gave up his old faithful Mac Mini that he's had since 2011.</p>
<p>Stan wants to know if I use an ad blocker. Stan recommends Ghostery.</p>
<p>Jon also got a new router! Stan hasn't said anything for the last month and half, so Jon had to bring it up.</p>
<p>We wrap up by talking about what we're watching.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
