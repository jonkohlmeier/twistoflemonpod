<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan has been on a purging spree. He's thinking about reading the Marie Kondo book and taking this to a whole new level.</p>
<p>That's actually the main topic of this episode, but somehow we touch on modern art, Andy Warhol, white space in design.</p>
<p>Ultimately this is a long talk about minimalism and cutting waste.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
