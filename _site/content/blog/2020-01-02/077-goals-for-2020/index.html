<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Happy 2020! We kick of this episode recapping what our 2019 goals/resolutions were. Stan went back to listen to what we talked about a year ago.</p>
<p>Jon appears to have crushed his goals while Stan was non-committal in setting any. He did read 40 books this year and he paid off his mortgage.</p>
<p>For 2020 -</p>
<p>Jon plans to read at least 5 days a week and draw better boundaries between work and personal time.</p>
<p>Stan is sitting in a pretty good spot. Perhaps his resolution is to have less strong opinions. He also might try to get on the bike some more. Jon suggests that he writes more.</p>
<p>We hope that you have a great 2020.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
