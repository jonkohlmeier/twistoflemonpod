<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Good news! Stan isn't as worried about going to jain for tax fraud anymore. Stan gives an update on the M1 MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The snow is gone in Indianapolis and melting in Cedar Rapids, so we start talking about lawn care. Jon takes a look at Stan's soil test and breaks down what he should be doing to start off the season.</p>
<p>We also answer a question from Patrick Sturdivant on brown spots in his St. Augustine lawn.</p>
<p>Stan dives into how he uses a work phone vs a personal cell phone.</p>
<p>And we review last week's episode of WandaVision.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
