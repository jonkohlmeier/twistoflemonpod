<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Winter is not over yet. Jon spent nearly 2 hours shoveling after the most recent snow storm. Stan asks Jon about snow removal tools and discovers that he finally ordered a snowblower! Somewhere in there we go off on a tangent on Star Trek.</p>
<p>All weekend Stan was tweeting about the Alliance. Jon learns that this isn't a World of Warcraft or Firefly reference.. but just more football. Needless to say, Stan is really excited about it.</p>
<p>We talk about twitter and whether it's a good platform to have a conversation/interview. #KaraJack.</p>
<p>Leave a review on iTunes. We'll read it on air and if you send Stan your address we'll send a sticker!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
