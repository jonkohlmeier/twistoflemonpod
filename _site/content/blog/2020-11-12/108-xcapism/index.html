<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan got an Xbox, Jon is still waiting for his. Stan has been flying around in a Tie Fighter in the meantime. Hopefully Jon will have his by the end of the year, if Amazon comes through.</p>
<p>We touch on the election a little bit and cut it short before we get in too much trouble.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about the Apple event this week and the new M1 chip.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, please share with a friend.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
