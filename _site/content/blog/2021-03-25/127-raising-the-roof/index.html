<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're back to the familiar and comforting format. Shorter episode with just Stan and Jon talking about random things. We talk about the shingles in Jon's driveway. Baseball Season, Xbox Wireless headsets and more.</p>
<p>Listen in and stick around for the post-credit scene if you're missing the Marvel banter.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
