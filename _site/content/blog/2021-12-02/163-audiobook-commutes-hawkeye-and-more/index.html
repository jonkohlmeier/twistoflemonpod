<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week Stan asks Jon about how he has been spending his commuting time. Turns out it has been with Audiobooks. We also talk about the football season, the new Hawkeye TV show, and whatever else comes to mind.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
