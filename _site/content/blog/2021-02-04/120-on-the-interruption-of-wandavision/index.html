<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We kick off the episode talking about WandaVision episode 4 &quot;We Interrupt this Program.&quot; We speculate on everything that is going on and welcome back some MCU Alumni.</p>
<p>Stan finished his trek through reading The Lord of the Rings. Jon gets nerdy and Stan liked it more than he liked the Hobbit.</p>
<p>Finally we give an update on what we've been playing on Xbox.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
