<p>Dear Financially Minded Listener,</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in for Episode 8! This week Jon met his mortgage savings goal so he seeks advice from the most experienced guy he knows - Stan Lemon (who has gone through the process 6 times.) Stan drops some knowledge and points out some mistakes he's made in the past. Listen in and you just might learn something!</p>
<p>The cohosts both failed to complete our Milkshake homework so the milkshake followup will have to wait for another episode.</p>
<p>Pay no attention to the lawnmower background noise. We're still amateurs who don't have nice sound proof studios. (Sorry Gillespie.)</p>
<p>We'll be back next week,</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jon Kohlmeier &amp; Stan Lemon</p>
