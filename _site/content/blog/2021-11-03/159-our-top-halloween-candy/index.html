<p>Dear Listener</p>
<p>This week we talk about Jon's life back in an office before jumping into our top halloween candy complete with a live taste test with a surprise guest!</p>
<p>From there we discus Form vs. Function as it applies to the MacBook and design in general.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
