<p>Dear listener,</p>
<p>Stan is liking Jon's new look - shaped beard, new glasses and all. Jon tells about his experience getting new glasses from Warby Parker.</p>
<p>The rest of the episode is spent discussion Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. This episode includes many many many spoilers. So stop the episode if you don't want anything to be spoiled.</p>
<p>Tune in next week to hear about our resolutions for 2020.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
