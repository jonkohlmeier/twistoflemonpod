<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we have feedback from a listener who lives in Montana. she paints the picture of a beautiful state which gets us talking about the most beautiful places that we have visited. Ultimately Stan decides that places can be beautiful and still &quot;nowhere.&quot;</p>
<p>We make it through some other listener feedback from after the last episode.</p>
<p>This week's life tip is to bring a washcloth with you when you travel. Stan gives us the reason why.</p>
<p>Today's Mastering Minimalism tip is &quot;Don't buy books.&quot; Jon and Stan have some words and different views on this.</p>
<p>Stan has been watching Apple TV+ since its release. He gives a brief review of what he's seen.</p>
<p>Finally, we talk about Twitter's recent policy change to not run political ads anymore. This is in contrast to how Facebook follows</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
