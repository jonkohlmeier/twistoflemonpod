<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Jon turned 30! Hear about his 30th birthday and Stan feeling old. You can still give him the gift of a 5 star review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Sunday was also Mother's Day. By request of Angie who works in the same building as Jon, we talk about what we did for our Mother's on Sunday.</p>
<p>We have a new written review on iTunes! Danchez from Iowa gives a glowing review, complete with making fun of the hosts. Check it out and write your own! In the meantime we're here for your enjoyment Danchez.</p>
<p>The adventures of a new home owner continues with Stan and Jon talking about Lawn care and Jon's new lawn tools.</p>
<p>Do people still read email newsletters? Stan wants to know. We also reminisce about Google Reader.</p>
<p>That leads into the current book that Stan is reading: Team of Rivals. Stan highly recommends this book about Lincoln and the building of his cabinet.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
