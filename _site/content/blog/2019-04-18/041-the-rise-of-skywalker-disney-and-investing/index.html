<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we kick off the episode explaining why we were recording early again. For both Game of Thrones and because it's Holy Week.</p>
<p>Disney rebased some big announcements that we give our take on. We're both excited for Disney+ and the content to come with it.</p>
<p>Which leads directly into the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker teaser discussion. We have a new hope after this teaser.</p>
<p>Finally Jon asks Stan about his new investing strategy and Stan gives us more information than we could have ever dreamed of.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening in!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
<p>P.S. Sorry Jon's audio is so bad. Looks like Audio Hijack picked up the wrong input source.</p>
