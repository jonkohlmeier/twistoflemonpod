<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're only $100 dollars away from reaching our goal in support of Pastor Fritsche.</p>
<p>Next up, Stan and Jon talk about New Years Resolutions. Neither are resolution purists but set certain goals and try to cultivate habits.</p>
<p>This week we also find out that Stan and Jon have significantly different ideas around what should appear on an iPhone home screen.</p>
<p>That leads into a discussion on note taking apps and task list apps.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier
