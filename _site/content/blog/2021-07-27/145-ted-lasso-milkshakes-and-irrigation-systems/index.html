<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Taliesin went in for his big surgery, so we talk about his cone of shame and that experience as a dog owner.</p>
<p>Jon finally started watching Ted Lasso, so we can actually talk about it on the podcast.</p>
<p>We also feature a milkshake review in this episode! From Frydae in Marion, IA.</p>
<p>Stan's irrigation system was finally installed! We talk about that experience and how it will take his lawn game to the next level.</p>
<p>Stick around for our last post-credit scene</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
