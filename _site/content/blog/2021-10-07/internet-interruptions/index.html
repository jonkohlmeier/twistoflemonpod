<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Are we getting closer to the fall of Facebook? Facebook was down for hours this week and they've been getting some really bad press recently.</p>
<p>This leads us into a discussion on the future of the podcast, the evolution of social media and basic right and wrong.</p>
<p>Finally Stan is having some more car issues that have him considering replacing the vehicle.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
