<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today we kick off the episode arguing semantics. Stan has yet another milkshake story. He attends a place with &quot;Shake&quot; in the name and is underwhelmed.</p>
<p>Regular listener Tom, sent us an article via twitter for our (read: Stan's) opinion. Hear us opine on the lockdown of Apple repairs.</p>
<p>This leads to a broader discussion on security and data privacy of all kinds.</p>
<p>Stan checks in on the Kohlmeier home buying adventure which leads into a discussion on 30 year vs 15 year mortgage.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear, leave us a review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>- Jon Kohlmeier</p>
