<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Merry Christmas! This week we reflect on a 2 hour episode. And get an update on Stan's Steelers.</p>
<p>Apparently people ask Stan about how Jon's roof is doing. In this episode you get a roof update.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about our Christmas plans and wish you our dear listener a merry Christmas.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
