<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week, we talk life hacks and pets stories. The episode kicks off with a life hack from a regular listener, keeping a Coozie inside a cargo short pocket. Other life hacks include always having a bottle opener with you and carrying a pocket knife.</p>
<p>We also talk about adventures in pet ownership.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
