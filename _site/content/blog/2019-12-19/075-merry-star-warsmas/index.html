<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Danchez liked our last episode! Nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>On that note we jump into a topic that we're sure he'll have strong opinions on. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - which is said to be the conclusion of the Skywalker Saga.</p>
<p>Jon doesn't have tickets yet. It releases this evening.</p>
<p>Jon also doesn't have a Christmas Tree up. Stan has been playing Christmas music for weeks, you can get a feel for his Christmas music tastes.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening - Let us know what you think of The Rise of Skywalker!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
