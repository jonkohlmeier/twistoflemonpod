<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>I'm not even really sure where to start for this episode. We cover a plethora of topics from tech to food, to reading non-fiction. You're sure to find something that interests you in this episode (even if it only is the soothing sound of The Lemon's voice) Maybe it will be easier if I just list some of the topics out.</p>
<ul>
<li>New recording settings</li>
<li>Milkshakes (of course)</li>
<li>Apple Activity</li>
<li>Meat, Rubbed and Salutary</li>
<li>Recipes</li>
<li>Killer iOS feature - Password manager.</li>
<li>Screen time and tactics to use phone less.</li>
<li>Reading Non-fiction books</li>
<li>Apollo 8</li>
<li>Art of Manliness episodes</li>
