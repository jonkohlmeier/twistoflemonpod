<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan ran into some interesting people in Indianapolis, at Wylipalooza of all places. But he didn't get a milkshake.</p>
<p>Stan is disappointed that we reached Episode 52 but we haven't been doing this for a year quite yet. We'll have a full on celebration here in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Stan did pay off his mortgage in the last week, we're curious what he's going to do next.</p>
<p>Apple has been in the news a couple of times recently, most notable for the departure of Jony Ive. We reflect on what he's done for Apple and wonder what will happen moving forward.</p>
<p>Another core tennant of the podcast is Marvel. So we talk about going to see Spider-Man far from Home and other things Marvel.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
