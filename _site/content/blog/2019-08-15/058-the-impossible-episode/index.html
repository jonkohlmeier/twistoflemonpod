<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Happy 47th birthday to Jon's father-in-law, Rev. Mark Buetow!</p>
<p>Stan got notified about the Apple Card, he seems so excited about it that he thought Jon was too.</p>
<p>We did something impossible to our bodies in the past week. Both Stan and Jon made trips to Burger King Stan ate a Whopper and an Impossible Whopper. Jon just opted for the impossible whopper.</p>
<p>Listen in for our stories and experiences with the Impossible Whopper.</p>
<p>Stan spent a couple of days in St. Louis, while there they caught a Pirates game at Busch Stadium.</p>
<p>We also talk briefly about Stan's blog post on how he paid off his mortgage.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear or have other food challenges for us, let us know online or by leaving a 5-star review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
