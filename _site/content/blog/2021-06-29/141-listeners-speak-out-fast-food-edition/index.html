<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Jon and Mrs. Kohlmeier are headed to visit LemonLand this week, tune in for more on those adventures.</p>
<p>Most of this episode is spent sharing our listeners ranking of Fast Food (apparently our lists caused some disagreement.)</p>
<p>Listen in, enjoy, and share with a friend.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
<p>P.S. If you'd like to hear about Loki, stick around for the post credits segment.</p>
