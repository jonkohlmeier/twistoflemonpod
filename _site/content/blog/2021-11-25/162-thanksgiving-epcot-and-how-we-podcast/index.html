<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving! On this episode we discuss our favorite Thanksgiving menu items and plans for this year. Stan tries to convince Jon that it's a good idea to spend a day at Epcot and we answer a question from regular listener Jeff (aka Sidd Finch) on how we produce the podcast.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and we hope you enjoy this on your post dinner walk or while you're braving Black Friday crowds!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
