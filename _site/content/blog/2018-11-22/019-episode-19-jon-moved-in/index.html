<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>In the last week Jon has closed on his house, cleaned carpets, finished packing and made the big move! Listen in to these last steps of the home purchase.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving - We talk through their thanksgiving plans and read through some iTunes reviews (you should leave one too!).</p>
<p>Finally, Stan alludes to a special announcement. Be sure to tune in next week for our exciting campaign.</p>
<p>We hope that you start a new Thanksgiving tradition of drinking milkshakes!</p>
<p>See you next week,</p>
<p>- Jon Kohlmeier
