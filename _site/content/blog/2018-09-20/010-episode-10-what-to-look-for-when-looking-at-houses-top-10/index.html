<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>The story of this week's episode is that Jon had a simple question for Stan that he texted on a Sunday evening after a google search failed him. The question went something like this: &quot;Top ten things to look at when your Realtor shows you houses.... go!&quot; I (Jon) expected a list! 10 Things! But there's no such thing as a simple question when it comes to Stan. He convinces me to dig up the secondary microphone in the home office and record after 8pm on a Sunday night.</p>
<p>I think we hit 10 things. I guess that I'll go back and listen again and see if I can't turn it into a text list. If you get to it before me feel free to send them via message on our <a href="https://facebook.com/twistoflemonpod">Facebook Page</a>.</p>
<p>We do review milkshakes from Arby's and Five Guys. Stan also attempted A &amp; W. So stick around for you weekly milkshake update.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jon &quot;in-search-of-a-house&quot; Kohlmeier
