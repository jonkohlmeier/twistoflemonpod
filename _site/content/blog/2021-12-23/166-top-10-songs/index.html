<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Merry Christmas! This week we talk about Christmas plans and cover a listener submitted topic: Our Top 10 Songs (Subjectively, like you'd listen to these 10 songs before you die or something like that.)</p>
<p>It turns into more of a 10 songs we like, plus some others. Hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
