<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today we have breaking news regarding Avengers 4: Endgame. We're excited and we can't wait.</p>
<p>That leads us into a conversation on web design including <a href="https://spacejam.com">spacejam.com</a>, <a href="https://marvel.com/captainmarvel">marvel.com/captainmarvel</a>, and <a href="https://airforce.com">airforce.com</a>.</p>
<p>You'll never guess what comes next. Milkshake reviews! Jon had 2 milkshakes in the last week. One from Cold Stone Creamery in Cedar Rapids and one from Julie Ann's Frozen Custard in Crystal Lake, IL. Stan visited a different Five Guys in Fort Wayne, IN.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about about the state of online banking especially Wealthfront and their opening of cash accounts. How do we use banks?</p>
<p>If you're interested in Wealthfront use this link: <a href="http://wlth.fr/1eAorix">http://wlth.fr/1eAorix</a> You'll get $5k of assets managed for free and you'll help Jon get $5k of assets managed for free.</p>
