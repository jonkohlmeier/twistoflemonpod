<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we are joined by regular guest Patrick &quot;Marvel Expert&quot; Sturdivant. We take a look at the final episode of WandaVision and step back and talk about the season as a whole.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here and what should we expect from Falcon and the Winter Soilder.</p>
<p>*Non-Marvel fans, don't worry. This will be our last completely Marvel related episode for a while. Next week we'll be back with another guest, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
