<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Spring is in the air and Jon is itching to get out and start lawn work. Stan asks about this years lawn strategy and how Jon will start off the spring.</p>
<p>We were sad to miss Fenker this week, since Stan doesn't like recording with multiple people in the room.</p>
<p>Finally we have the weekly recap of Star Trek Picard.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear please leave us a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
