<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This turned out to be a sort of catch up in the life of Jon and Stan episode. Stan is having some football woes which leads to a lament to kick off the episode.</p>
<p>Stan didn't add a lot to our list of talking points. So Jon added random things including an EcoBee update, reading updates and bicycling updates.</p>
<p>There's also considerable talk of fire in this episode, Jon's lesson learned while grilling, what kind of gas can he should buy and more.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about prioritization and queuing.</p>
<p>Listen in - let us know if you have ideas for us to talk about.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
