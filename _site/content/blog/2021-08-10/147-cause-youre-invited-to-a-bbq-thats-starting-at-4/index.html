<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan has dubbed this our &quot;summertime episode&quot;. We start off talking all things BBQ. Stan got a new smoker and Jon has been using his to smoke new and exciting things. We talk about the Treager and pork shoulders and chicken wings.</p>
<p>Jon also helped Stan pick out a new mower. He had some trouble with the first one, but was able to exchange it for a mower that everyone can be happy with.</p>
