<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we start off with yet another correction, this time Jon messed up.</p>
<p>We have a couple of new reviews first a listener reviewed us on iTunes, then Jon reviews a milkshake.</p>
<p>We talk about the jam-packed WWDC keynote and highlights from the announcements. Listen in to get our take an all things Apple.</p>
<p>Finally we get around to talking about where we do our best work. Not necessarily location based, but what has to be true to do the best work.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening! Leave a review!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
