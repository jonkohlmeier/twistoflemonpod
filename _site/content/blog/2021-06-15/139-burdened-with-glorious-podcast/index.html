<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're not sure if we'll keep posting on Tuesdays, but I guess we'll see. This week we're realizing on Tuesday again so you can hear our first reactions on Loki before the next episode.</p>
<p>If you want to hear Mrs. Lemon and Mrs. Kohlmeier on the podcast let us know with your best persuasive reasons why!</p>
<p>We have some brief follow up on Apple Spacial audio and some other news from WWDC on the developer side - including Stan's 5 minutes of fame!</p>
<p>Finally we go all in on Loki and we're pretty happy with episode 1.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
