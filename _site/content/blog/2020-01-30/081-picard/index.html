<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan had a rough week. He returned all of his shoes, his trusty robovac broke and he had a rough customer support experience.</p>
<p>Mastering Minimalism this week we talk about clearing out your storage spaces.</p>
<p>Life Tip is to give yourself an extra day after travel.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about Star Trek Picard and our initial thoughts and reviews. We will be spoiling the episode, even if we think you have no excuse at this point.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
