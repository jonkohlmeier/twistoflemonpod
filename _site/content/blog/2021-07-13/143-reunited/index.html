<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>In this episode we review Jon's visit to Stan in Indianapolis. All core tenants of the podcast were observed: Meat, Milkshakes, Macs, and Mixology (And Marvel but we don't talk about that until the post-credit scene.). Listen in, it was a fun time together after not seeing each other in person for the first time in 19 months.</p>
<p>We also talk about some announcements including the trailer for the Many Saints of Newark and the new Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
