<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We want to know where and when you listen to the podcast. This continues to surprise us.</p>
<p>Stan is going all in on Christmas decorating both indoors and outdoor. He's usually a little crazy with the Christmas music.</p>
<p>We've also started playing Xbox games together which is far more fun for Jon than waiting for Steelers games.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
