<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Turns out our friend Joe doesn't like wings, but Aaron Fenker has shipped his hamburger seasoning to us!</p>
<p>Stan blew his daughters mind by having the Donut Fairy visit the house.</p>
<p>Finally we get into the meat of the episode with our review of the new iOS and watchOS updates. We cover the good the bad and the underwhelming.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
