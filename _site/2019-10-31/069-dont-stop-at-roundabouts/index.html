    <p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in again this week. We start off the episode talking about Kansas. Stan doesn't back down from Kansas being &quot;nowhere&quot; as he shares his definition of nowhere. We discuss how there are things to do in Kansas, just nothing that Stan would want to do.. except visit a presidential library.</p>
<p>We have a life tip this week from Stan - Don't stop at roundabouts. There's a lot of anger behind this life tip. Listen in, take it to heart and don't do anything stupid.</p>
<p>We have a minimalist tip again this week. Today we focus on the wallet. Jon cleans out his wallet as Stan talks about what little he carries on him.</p>
<p>Finally, you can hear what we said about Game 7 of the World Series just before it aired. Turns out the good guys won!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>If you have any topics that you'd like us to cover, let us know on social media or through our contact form.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
