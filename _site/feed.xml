<p>This week we release episode 5 of the <strong>Life with a Twist of Lemon</strong> podcast.  Stan and I recently saw <strong>Ant Man and the Wasp</strong>. So we take a look at the movie itself and its place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You should probably watch the movie first if you don't want it spoiled.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen the movie and don't care about spoilers, listen in for the MCU insights.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

<p>In Episode 6 of Life with a Twist of Lemon, Stan tells us about his trip to Atlanta for work. He has Jon salivating over some of the food he found and looking up plane tickets to head to Atlanta.</p>
<p>All of that somehow leads into Jon's new Amazon Echo, the greatest trivia device ever... but at what cost? From there they go down the trail of home automation, current smart devices and future plans. (Stan will probably keep just using Alexa as a fancy timer.)</p>
<p>Let us know what else we should use our home assistants for on social media.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>LWaToL Hosts</p>
<p><em>P.S. Sorry for setting off your Alexa devices multiple times this episode.</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>If you want to hear us talk about milkshakes for an abnormal amount of time, you won't want to miss this episode! Stan kicks off the episode talking about his day trip to Fort Wayne and how there are now places to eat. We follow up on our milkshake discussion with some milkshake recommendations and milkshakes to avoid. Finally the Lemon turns sour and lets out his anger against Twitter and their killing of his favorite Twitter apps.</p>
<p>As a bonus you'll hear about Jon's new Mac, Stan's first experience watching the Lord of the Rings films, Baby Got Brunch, and more!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy and share this episode with anyone you think might find it interested.</p>

<p>Thanks for tuning in for Episode 8! This week Jon met his mortgage savings goal so he seeks advice from the most experienced guy he knows - Stan Lemon (who has gone through the process 6 times.) Stan drops some knowledge and points out some mistakes he's made in the past. Listen in and you just might learn something!</p>
<p>The cohosts both failed to complete our Milkshake homework so the milkshake followup will have to wait for another episode.</p>
<p>Pay no attention to the lawnmower background noise. We're still amateurs who don't have nice sound proof studios. (Sorry Gillespie.)</p>
<p>We'll be back next week,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>The story of this week's episode is that Jon had a simple question for Stan that he texted on a Sunday evening after a google search failed him. The question went something like this: &quot;Top ten things to look at when your Realtor shows you houses.... go!&quot; I (Jon) expected a list! 10 Things! But there's no such thing as a simple question when it comes to Stan. He convinces me to dig up the secondary microphone in the home office and record after 8pm on a Sunday night.</p>
<p>I think we hit 10 things. I guess that I'll go back and listen again and see if I can't turn it into a text list. If you get to it before me feel free to send them via message on our <a href="https://facebook.com/twistoflemonpod">Facebook Page</a>.</p>
<p>We do review milkshakes from Arby's and Five Guys. Stan also attempted A &amp; W. So stick around for you weekly milkshake update.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>In this episode, Stan Lemon reviews Meat Rubs by Fenker (or.. Meat, Rubbed, and Salutary - branding pending.) Stan gives a good review but the only way to get them are to be friends with Rev. Aaron Fenker.</p>
<p>Stan got new Apple Gear, much of the world got new apple software, listen in for our discussion on that.</p>
<p>Milkshakes appeared, of course. You can hear a tale of two Five Guys milkshakes.</p>
<p>And to wrap it all up we get to what we planned to talk about. Investing 101. We talk saving strategies and basic investing.</p>
<p>If that doesn't give you a good idea of what life with a Twist of Lemon is... I don't know what will.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with us!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today we kick off the episode arguing semantics. Stan has yet another milkshake story. He attends a place with &quot;Shake&quot; in the name and is underwhelmed.</p>
<p>Regular listener Tom, sent us an article via twitter for our (read: Stan's) opinion. Hear us opine on the lockdown of Apple repairs.</p>
<p>This leads to a broader discussion on security and data privacy of all kinds.</p>
<p>Stan checks in on the Kohlmeier home buying adventure which leads into a discussion on 30 year vs 15 year mortgage.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear, leave us a review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We have a sweeter Lemon join us at the beginning of this episode. Lucy tells us about her milkshake experience which leads into even more milkshake talk. Surprisingly they had very similar milkshakes. Those of you in the Indianapolis area should check out <a href="http://wyliepalooza.com">Wyliepalooza</a>. If you're in Cedar Rapids be sure to check out <a href="https://www.almostfamouspopcorn.com">Almost Famous Popcorn</a>.</p>
<p>If you're sick of listening to us talk about Milkshakes and would like to do something more productive with your time skip to around the 19 minute mark. At the request of our listener Jeff, we talk about how our days look and how we seemingly get so much done in a day.</p>
<p>We think the key to productivity is trimming the waste. Jon and Stan have somewhat different takes on the matter. Listen in to how they tackle their ToDos.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, If you like what you hear - please leave us a 5-star review on iTunes.</p>

<p>If you're sick of milkshake talk skip the first 3.5 minutes. From there we rejoice in our first iTunes written review AND the first great mystery of Life with a Twist of Lemon.</p>
<p>Jon used the Meat Rubs by Fenker that he received in the mail and gives his review.</p>
<p>Bad news for Netflix / Marvel Fans. Stan and Jon discuss the cancellation of Luke Cage and Iron Fist.</p>
<p>Jon gives an update on the House Hunt.</p>
<p>Finally - Stan suggests a book for Jon to read: &quot;Creative Selection.&quot; A book that Stan says is one of the best books in technology. Jon also wants to make a look at &quot;It doesn't have to be crazy at work.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks for listening - leave a review and we just might talk about you too!</p>

Good news - No bad reviews on Reddit yet!

<p>Good news - No bad reviews on Reddit yet!</p>
<p>Why did we skip trick or treating to go to a church service? We talk through some reasons in this episode. The big reason ends up being the hymns. (You might even catch Jon singing.) Bottom line is good hymns trump candy.</p>
<p>In light of next week's elections, Jon asks Stan how he reasons out who to vote for.</p>
<p>After that downer - Jon has a milkshake review from Freddy's Frozen Custard.</p>
<p>Apple announced new hardware for the iPad Pro, Mac mini, and MacBook Air. Did Stan order anything? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Listen in, rate us (5 stars) on iTunes, post any complaints on Reddit and we'll talk to you next week!</p>

<p>As of this episode you may be listening on Spotify!</p>
<p>Following up on last episode's discussion, Stan tells us about his Reformation service experience. Jesus Christ is the light of the World and Stan's church made it through 1/3 of the service with only candlelight and a cappella singing.</p>
<p>Due to busy schedules, we recorded earlier than expected so no real time election followup. We're all ready for the advertisements and the discussions to end. Stan tells me why voting is a civic duty and makes a good case for me to go and vote.</p>
<p>Now that everyone is depressed by political discussions, we can go back to Marvel, milkshakes, and my home buying process. Stan call me out on creating a Kanban board to manage the packing and moving process (See <a href="https://facebook.com/twistoflemonpod">Facebook</a> for a picture). Check in to see how Anna is dealing with this all. You may see a blog post on this when I have time to sit down and write one.</p>
<p>Stan also bought some Crypto this week.. we'll see how that goes.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in, thanks for those of you who have written reviews on iTunes! We have some exciting stuff coming soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>A new Italian Beef place opened up in Cedar Rapids, I give my review (unfortunately no milkshakes on the menu). Stan describes what an Italian beef is, because apparently they're kind of a regional thing.</p>
<p>Stan Lee died this week, we remember the creator of Marvel and spend some time talking about his work.</p>
<p>I voted... and started more political talk. The episode is saved with a Jon Moving Update. Stan is surviving life and the Lemon house doesn't appear to be falling apart this week.</p>
<p>Listen in, have fun, write a review on iTunes: we'll be talking about some on air next week!</p>
<p>Talk to you later,</p>
